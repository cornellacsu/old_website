    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">In one fateful winter break, a few students involved with Association for Computer Science Undergraduates (ACSU) wanted to provide a resource that not only addressed a handful of frequently asked questions but also provide a more comprehensive guide to the Computer Science major at Cornell University than what the Unofficial CS Wiki offered. Given that this is the first iteration, we hope that this guide will (1) serve as one of many useful resources that underclassmen can use to acclimate to Cornell University as a CS major or minor and (2) be further improved by experienced upperclassmen who have accumulated helpful perspectives being in Cornell&rsquo;s CS community. </span></p>

    <h2 class="c13" id="h.3qa5un1tk31t"><span class="c8">General</span></h2>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.sxxhtg9hqv8p"><span class="c18 c10">Is there any benefit in majoring in Computer Science through the College of Arts and Sciences vs College of Engineering?</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">The general consensus for this question appears to be that there is </span><span class="c10">no significant difference</span><span class="c5">. There appears to be a lot of students asking this, and most of them seem to have the wrong impression that majoring in one college over another is more &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo;; however, this is not the case. The only difference in which school you are majoring from is all of the requirements outside of the Computer Science major. For example, College of Engineering requires students to take PHYS 1112 and 2213, whereas College of A&amp;S does not. However, the College of A&amp;S also requires students to take a language course and fulfill other &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; requirements. Yet, to complete the CS major, they need to take the same set of core classes (CS 2800, CS 3110, CS 3410/3420, CS 4410, CS 4820), 3 4000-level CS classes, 3 external specialization classes, and a few other requirements. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">It should also be noted that Engineering students graduate with a </span><span class="c10">Bachelor of Science</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and Arts students graduate with a </span><span class="c10">Bachelor of Arts.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Some reasons that have been observed in the past to transfer from one school to another is the following:</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_aec3f6ago8rt-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">a student in CALS (or any other college), which does not have a CS major, transfers to CAS or CoE to earn a Computer Science major</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">a student with a lot of AP credits (say ones that fulfill PHYS 1112 and PHYS 2213) cannot have them count towards graduation in one college (CAS), but can in another (CoE) </span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">a student does not want to fulfill a certain requirement (does not want to take a language class - go to CoE!, or hates Physics with an extreme passion - go to CAS!)</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">a student wants to double major in a field, but the second major is not offered in the particular college they currently are affiliated with (e.g. Mathematics is offered as a major in CAS but is not offered as a major in CoE) </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.c82ljgxztc58"><span class="c18 c10">Do I NEED a Mac? Can I get by with a PC? Will my choice of laptops affect my ability to become a Computer Science major? What laptop would you recommend to a prospective CS major? </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">A CS major at Cornell University can DEFINITELY get by with either a PC or a Mac. If you have familiarity, Linux is also a perfectly workable option. Most classes use Virtual Machines to provide students with the required software that is needed for the class. For classes that don&rsquo;t, their course staff usually tries their best to accommodate both. However, if you have interest in developing iPhone applications, a Mac is the way to go. A Mac is also nice in that it has a Unix environment, which makes many kinds of development easier. Bearing all these in mind, however, most people choose based on their personal preferences. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.39lsf5pg8yv8"><span class="c18 c10">I don&rsquo;t have prior CS knowledge; am I screwed?</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Not at all! Although it is common for students to have prior exposure to Computer Science before their first year at Cornell, it is perfectly okay for students to have no prior experience whatsoever. In fact, introductory classes such as CS 1110 and CS 1112 are geared towards students with no prior background. There have been many students who excel as a Computer Science major at Cornell University who have no experience before college, and you can be one too!</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.s9r7624sgy7g"><span class="c18 c10">When should I affiliate? What are the benefits in affiliating?</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">You should affiliate as soon as you are eligible if you have committed to the major. For most students applying for affiliation occurs during sophomore year, but in some cases it&rsquo;s possible to affiliate even earlier. College of Engineering students have no choice but to apply before the end of your sophomore year or you will be withdrawn from the college, but CAS students are free to begin the process during their fourth semester. You submit the paperwork to affiliate during the semester that take the last of the required courses.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The requirements for affiliation are as follows:</span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_h94xjmse2sxu-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">cumulative GPA &gt;= 2.0 (CoE-only requirement)</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">at least a C in all competed CS and math course</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">GPA &gt;= 2.5 in CS 2110/2112 and CS 2800</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">GPA &gt;= 2.5 in MATH 1120/1220/1920 and CS 2800</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">If you don&rsquo;t meet these requirements, don&rsquo;t despair! Some deficiencies can be offset by excelling in other areas. Check out the </span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/CSMajor%23csmajor&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1505577504979000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6WmqeDPCrePsfYyq_i1H3UjIB6g">CS Major website</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;for more information. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">It&rsquo;s definitely good to affiliate by your third semester if you can; if you can&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry too much about it. One of the few differences the timing could make is in pre-enrolling for fourth semester classes. Many 4000+ level CS courses are available only to CS/IS majors during pre-enroll, so there is a slight advantage to sophomores who are already affiliated by then. More perks that are offered to CS majors are access to the undergraduate computing lab (UGClab) in Gates G33, official access to the CIS undergraduate lab (although the door is usually open anyway), and CS-related emails from the awesome Nicole Roy!</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">It is definitely good to decide the double majors as early as possible (especially with Computer Science) because then you can plan the courses ahead and don&rsquo;t have to panic as you become an upperclassmen. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">For students with Computer Science major in College of Arts and Sciences, you can choose to count courses in a second major or minor as electives.</span></p>

    <h3 class="c6" id="h.2q3hh8dfm6el"><span class="c18 c10">Should I take CS 1110 or CS 1112?</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">CS 1110 teaches you the basics of Computer Science in using the Python programming language, whereas CS 1112 teaches you the basics using the Matlab language. Because writing code in Python is less complex, more readable, and is easier to transition to learn how to write code in other popular languages such as Java, most prospective CS majors elect to take CS 1110. However, CS 1112 would be a good choice for students who are interested in classes associated with Computational Science &amp; Engineering (CS 4210, CS 4220) or have interest in other science fields outside of Computer Science because it is useful for mathematical computations. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.1sd1bbo5y6ub"><span class="c18 c10">Should I take CS 2110 or CS 2112?</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Both courses cover similar material. However, CS 2112 is well-known for its extensive projects. If you are looking to getting experience on working on a significant codebase and have the time to afford to, CS 2112 might be the course for you. Also there is an option to switch back to CS 2110 from CS 2112 within the first three weeks, so if you find the assignments and the overall pace of CS 2112 to be a bit much, switching back to CS 2110 is always an option.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">With that said, CS 2110 also covers a significant breadth of material, and by the end of it, students should be exposed to a variety of technical concepts that are not only covered in other higher-level CS courses but also prepare students to begin preparing for technical interviews. So in terms of the material covered, students enrolled in CS 2110 are not missing out on anything significant. For students who have taken CS 2110, they are generally able to invest more time into other courses as well, as CS 2110&rsquo;s projects are not on the scale of CS 2112. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.dsusaqhy96wq"><span class="c18 c10">Should I take CS 3410 or CS 3420 / ECE 3140?</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This answer partially depends on whether you can fit ENGRD/ECE 2300 (a prerequisite for 3420) into your schedule. Because CS majors in the College of Engineering are required to take 2 engineering distributions, ENGRD/ECE 2300 is a popular choice due to its material being most relevant to the CS major out of other ENGRD options (the other being filled by ENGRD 2110 or ENGRD 2112, which is required for the major). If you can manage to fit ENGRD/ECE 2300 into your schedule and want to avoid overlapping content, taking CS 3420 (crosslisted as ECE 3140) may be the better option. However, if you want to reinforce the material taught in ENGRD/ECE 2300, taking CS 3410 might be better. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Now that CS 3410 is offered in both the Fall and the Spring, fitting that into your schedule is much more flexible than trying to fit in CS 3420, which is only offered in the Spring semester. If this is of concern to you, taking CS 3410 might be a better option.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">In terms of comparing the courses themselves, CS 3410 is pretty well known to be filled with projects that are very time consuming. CS 3420 on the other hand have very reasonable projects up until the final project (open-ended), in which the time commitment can vary wildly depending on the type of projects students wish to pursue. CS 3410 also squeezes in a lot more material than CS 3420 does. This, however, is more like comparing to apples to oranges, as the combination of ENGRD 2300 and CS 3420 covers all the material covered by CS 3410 and more. In that sense, if you want to spread out the material you want to learn in the duration of a year rather than the semester, the ENGRD 2300-CS 3420 might be of more interest (and vice versa).</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Lastly, CS 3420 places more emphasis on I/O and hardware-related material (hence its name, Embedded Systems). In fact, most projects in CS 3420 involve coding logic onto a microcontroller (MSP430). This is highlighted by the final project which gives student freedom to pursue whatever project they wish to with their MSP430s. Therefore, if you have more interest in hardware systems, CS 3420 might be for you. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.qb87fwi5wdll"><span class="c18 c10">What is a practicum? What separates it from a regular course?</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">With the exception of CS 2111, practicums are classes that are based entirely on projects. Usually, given a class CS xxx0, its associated practicum will be offered as CS xxx1. Every CS major is required to take one practicum, and can choose to enroll in multiple practicums if they wish. The practicums are meant to be extensions of the associated course, and usually students get to implement a variety of things covered in lecture but are not explored in other parts of the class. For example, for CS 4320: Intro to Database Systems, lectures encompass various components of databases, and in CS 4321, students get to implement a SQL-interpreter in Java where they actually code up and learn the ins-and-outs of the discussed components. For some classes, the practicum must be taken along with the actual course (e.g. CS 4120 + 4121).</span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.40cndcnr3isn"><span class="c18 c10">Why are some 4000-level classes cross-listed as 5000-level classes? </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">If a 4000-level class is cross-listed as a 5000-level class, that means that the same course is offered to both undergraduate students and graduate students. Therefore, unless you are a graduate student, you should sign up for the 4000-level class as CS 4xxx instead of CS 5xxx. The class and all requirements are generally the exact same.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.vtc15ce4grba"><span class="c18 c10">What is a vector? Is it important in any way? Is one more prestigious than another? </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">Think of vectors as a guideline of which courses to take if you are interested in a certain subject (like a </span><span class="c11 c40">concentration</span><span class="c11">). Fulfilling a vector is necessary to graduate, but note that vector requirements can double count. Outside of the context of Cornell Computer Science, vectors are not too important and don&rsquo;t even show up on your transcript. However, they can be very useful in trying to shape your future coursework and determine which courses to take. Keep in mind that vectors are not hard requirements as much as they are a checklist of courses, so a class taken as a CS major requirement </span><span class="c10">can</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;double count as a vector requirement. More information about vectors can be found </span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/csmajor/vectors&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1505577504986000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSm0I5tOHrqCLUGKvpmtQNswu6bg">here</a></span><span class="c5">.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.dcuflkxo89wj"><span class="c18 c10">What are prerequisites? Are they actually enforced? </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Many courses build off the material in prior courses, either directly or indirectly. In order to ensure that all students have the same background, departments designate certain other courses as prerequisites that must be completed before enrolling in a subsequent course. Historically the CS department has allowed students to take classes for which they did not have the prerequisites, though doing so is not recommended. If you do not meet the prerequisites for a certain course it is recommended that you speak with the instructor, since sometimes they only serve as a way to ensure that you have some previous experience with the topic.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.xmvmdcjllequ"><span class="c18 c10">I am struggling as a CS major, and I need additional resources for help; how can I go about doing this? </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">If you are struggling with a particular CS class, the first approach would be to try to go to Office Hours and seek help from TAs. Professors will generally also hold an hour or two of office hours, but if they are at a time you can&rsquo;t make then free to try to arrange a meeting with a professor by catching them after class or through e-mail. Professors and TAs are here to help your learning experience, and can be surprisingly helpful in pinpointing the source of your struggles. In some cases, Professors may help find you a personal tutor for the course. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">In addition to the course staff, introductory classes have external resources that can help. For example, CS 1110, CS 1112, and CS 2110 all have on-call</span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/academics/undergraduate/assistance/tutor/index.cfm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1505577504988000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoNMR5lt4ND3KfrF78tBkWx1hxUA">&nbsp;peer tutors</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/academics/undergraduate/curriculum/courses/workshops/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1505577504989000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENn_L56gzfrD0SntfIs1rTVqyLow">Academic Excellence Workshops</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;which are 1-credit supplemental courses.

    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The nice thing about Computer Science is that a lot of information can be found online as well. If you don&rsquo;t understand a certain concept presented in lecture and staring at the slides doesn&rsquo;t help, Googling for understanding can yield surprisingly helpful resources. Stack Overflow is especially useful.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">Internships are a great way for students to explore potential career paths and interests, learn more about the company that they are interning for, and learn what being a software developer is like in the real world. People usually apply for internships through the career fair and </span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cornell.joinhandshake.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1505577504992000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFod3Mi1Ox_iJrojejWUWazu2pkiw">Handshake</a></span><span class="c11">. This is not the only means, however, as most companies have links on their websites specifically for internships applications. Generally, an applicant needs to fill out basic information about themselves as well as a resume that highlights their technical skills, coursework, and achievements. If you perform well at an internship, most companies will give a </span><span class="c11 c40">return offer</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to either come back as an intern the next year or as a full-time employee - depending on your graduation date.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c6" id="h.zjl42ibpfj"><span class="c18 c10">What type of information should my resume contain? </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Typically, a resume for a software-related intern position contains information such as&hellip;</span></p>

    <h3 class="c6" id="h.wo1ym8dabj26"><span class="c10 c18">What is a typical technical interview like for a CS major applying for a Software (Development) Engineering Internship position? </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Typically after a brief conversation to introduce yourself, most Software Engineering internship positions will require the candidate to solve one or more technical interview questions. This will most of the time involve concepts introduced in CS 2110/2. Depending on the set up, this is usually done on the whiteboard (in-person interview) or on a website that provides code-friendly platform (phone interview). A sample question can be something like:</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11 c40">Given two lists of numbers A and B in which B contains all of the elements of A and one additional element, return the element that belongs in B but not in A. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Afterwards, interviewers typically take some time to talk more about the company, the work they do, and open up time for questions. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">To summarize, the Master of Science in Computer Science program lasts 4 semesters and requires 34 credits to graduate, 6-12 of those credits dedicated to your thesis research. It&rsquo;s required that you work as a TA for each of those semesters. However, you do receive full tuition and a housing stipend while you are in the program. To be accepted into the program, you will need your college transcript, 3 letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose, and an essay describing how a CS MS aligns with your career plans; all of which are due in mid-December.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">A Ph.D. is a roughly 6-year commitment, which is almost entirely devoted to doing research. Applications are typically due mid-December of your senior year, and typically require 3 recommendation letters, a statement of purpose, transcript, and GRE scores. Unlike undergrad there is really only main one criteria for admission: whether the university believes that you can excel at doing research. Naturally the best way to demonstrate this is to have undergraduate research experience, which you can read more about below.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">These classes are required for anyone majoring in computer science. With the exception of CS 2110 and CS 2800 (which are often taken together), it is generally recommended that students should take one core class each semester. However, that isn&rsquo;t to say taking more than one (say, CS 4820 and CS 3410) is impossible. See the Alternatives to the Core Classes section below for alternate classes, and why you might want to take them instead.</span></p>

    <h4 class="c44" id="h.142vjd223qf7"><span class="c27">CS 1110: Introduction to Computing Using Python</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The first course in the computer science sequence, this is a recommended course to take for all newcomers. It will cover all the necessary skills that every coder has with them, from variables to functions and beyond. Can be waived with AP Computer Science credit (may vary in CAS and CoE departments, however).</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The class is historically taught by Walker White in the fall and then a pair of professors in the Spring. Because the Spring curriculum is based off Professor Walker&rsquo;s personally designed Fall curriculum, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any major differences in taking it in either semester. Also because it is an introductory class into the CS world, the class tends to have a large number of consultants whose jobs are also to give advice and insight into the rest of the CS major. There are one-on-one meetings designed into the class for any questions you may have, so make sure to take advantage of those resources if you need them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The projects are very straightforward and as long as you&rsquo;re paying attention in class/lab and reading instructions carefully, you&rsquo;ll do well. The most noteworthy project is the last one where you&rsquo;ll be tasked to build your own version of Breakout. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Projects can be done in pairs of two or alone. While it might be beneficial to have a partner to talk with, be careful in dividing up work--since this is an introductory class, you definitely want to get good grasp of the course material.</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Typically taught by David Gries and one other CS professor, this class forms the core of many CS topics and forms the basis of general CS knowledge. Many 4000 level courses will have this class as their highest requirement. A very large portion of programming interviews use material from this class.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This class has a lighter amount of work compared to other CS classes. There are seven projects which can be completed with a partner. There are two prelims and an optional final. Grades in homeworks are typically very high (~90) while prelim grades follow a normal distribution (average between 65 and 75). This means that prelims are weighted heavily when deciding grades, so study up.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">This course introduces you to the paradigm of </span><span class="c11 c40">functional programming</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;in a language called OCaml, which may be quite different from anything you&rsquo;ve seen until now. The goal of the course is not to just teach you a fancy new programming style but to use it as a tool to help you learn to be better software engineers overall. Topics covered include:</span></p>

    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Usually the course is a general introduction to functional programming concepts and how they can be applied to real software engineering, but sometimes the course is more mathematical/theoretical, going into depth on topics such as type theory and the constructive real numbers.<br></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The course consists of lectures as well as but also two weekly recitations taught by undergraduate TAs. Each recitation is taught by two TAs; they are a fantastic resource to not only ask questions and clarify concepts with peers, but also for hands-on experience, as some recitations involve coding. Recitations will not only go in depth on important topics covered in lecture, but also cover topics more directly related to problem sets.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This course, like CS 3410, is a significant jump in difficulty/workload from CS 2110, so it would definitely be wise to start projects early and stay on top of the material if you haven&rsquo;t gotten into this habit already. There are usually 5-7 projects that consist mostly of programming in OCaml. In the past, the course has varied with regards to working with partners. Last time it was taught by Constable, for example, it featured mostly individual projects; only one was in pairs. There has also been semesters where all projects were pair or group projects. In Clarkson last offering the first few projects were individual, while the next few were (optionally) done with a partner, and the final project was a group project (mandatory) with 3-4 team members. Historically, this final project allows each group more freedom in their software engineering choices, but also expects much more creativity and ingenuity to come from the assignment.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This course aims to bridge the gap between software and hardware through topics such as computer organization, systems programming, and hardware/software interface. In terms of the work, you are required to work in a pair for all of the the projects. The homeworks and labs are done individually. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">PA1 and PA2 require you to make a MIPS pipelined-processor through a program called Logisim, which is used to build circuits. PA2 builds on PA1 but is considered to be harder than PA1 since it can be tricky to figure out all the edge cases. PA3 requires you to program a bot in C to compete in a &nbsp;&ldquo;cache race.&rdquo; This one is easier relatively than the others if you correctly implement a straightforward strategy and utilize all of the available cores. The last project, PA4, is implementing a dynamic memory allocator (malloc) in C. A lot of problems arise due to the fact that students are still unfamiliar with commons errors found in C. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Naturally, this class moves fast since it has to cover materials covered in both ECE 2300 and CS 3420. Reading the book will be a very good supplement. Overall, the materials covered in the class are important to master for any choice of career in CS. The course is also good to know for CS 4410 (Operating Systems), since the material continues approximately where 3410 left off and students use the same tools that you&rsquo;ve learned here for OS projects. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Historically there have been 2 prelims and no final exam (final project instead). Projects and Labs are worth ~50% of the final grade, while exams and homeworks are worth the other ~50% (subject to change). </span></p>

Larger projects have been known to take longer than 30 hours.</span></p>

Even if you are signed up for CS 4411, there will usually be 1 or 2 MPs you are still required to do. In the past, there have generally been 4 MPs on the following topics:</span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_wi9izgh81oq5-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Synchronization questions involving semaphores and monitors, and race conditions (done in Python)</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Implementing malloc (done in C) [may change in fall 2017 due to this now being covered in CS 3410]</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Implementing a given protocol (done in Python)</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Implementing a part of a file system (has been done in both Python and C before)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The projects themselves aren&rsquo;t too difficult. The first one will be very helpful for preparing for the first prelim and provide students exposure to synchronization questions. For the rest, try to read over the writeup for the projects very carefully, as even overlooking a minor detail may cost you a significant amount of points, especially as grading for many of the assignments is completely decided by the autograder test cases. Never break the 12 commandments of synchronization!</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Another general advice for the MPs would be to try to sketch out what you will be doing before actually implementing the code. Although this is a general advice that can apply to virtually any CS class, this is especially important in OS when you have to, say, implement a protocol that will be designed to respond in a specific manner depending on the context. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">Workload: </span><span class="c5">If you are not taking it with CS 4411, the workload is on the lighter side. Once you have a good understanding of the writeup for the projects, they don&rsquo;t take too much time. However, obtaining a good understanding may take some time, so don&rsquo;t put it off until the last minute. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to clarify any details that you have with the writeup with TAs and professors, as that can save you a significant amount of time! </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This course stays true to its name and exposes students to various algorithms and how to argue for its correctness. The types of algorithms introduced include&hellip;</span></p>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_1npu11alppwv-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Gale-Shapley matching algorithm</span></li>

    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The course has weekly problem sets that usually consists of three problems (two on a short week). Almost all of the problems involve (1) coming up with an algorithm to solve the problem of interest (2) write a proof to explain why the algorithm you proposed solves the problem (3) reason about runtime when applicable. Starting Spring 2016, some problem sets actually included a problem that involved coding up in Java an algorithm learned during the previous week. </span></p>

        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">the textbook, written by Cornell professors (Eva Tardos and Jon Kleinberg) is super comprehensive and is structured just like the lectures. If you ever had to buy a textbook, this would be the most helpful one in terms of how much it will actually help you with the class</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">even if you plan to put off doing the problem set until a later time, try to read the problems as soon as they are released. Just thinking about the problems in your downtime can save a lot of time when you actually get down to doing it</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">if you haven&rsquo;t used LaTeX much up until this point&hellip; be prepared! Sometimes typing up your answers can take longer time than actually doing the problem, so make sure to always leave enough time to type </span></li>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">Workload: </span><span class="c5">The best description of the workload for CS 4820 is constant.

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">These classes can be taken alongside their respective core classes, to enhance your understanding of the material and to reinforce topics.</span></p>

    <h4 class="c44" id="h.b300wikrjkq0"><span class="c27">CS 2111: Programming Practicum</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Weekly supplemental class for CS 2110; credited S/U. This course does NOT fulfill the CS project requirement despite being called a practicum. Usually is taught by the course instructor(s) and delves deeper into topics covered in recent CS 2110 lectures. Before exams, it can also double as a review or Q&amp;A session. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">For this class, you and your partner will be graded solely on the 6 projects that you work on throughout the semester. All of the projects are written in C, and each take a considerable amount of time (Heavy workload). Each project delves deeper into a topic that was briefly introduced in the lecture, which gives you a deeper understanding of the material. If you take this class, you only have to do the first Mini Project (MP) for OS and ignore the other ones. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">The projects are estimated to be around 30-40 hours of work, but they are spaced out 2-3 weeks apart. Note that the first 4 projects build on each other. If you have a mistake on project 1, you must fix it before you turn in project 2 or else you will lose points. Or even worse, you will run into a huge error later down the line. More often, significant points are lost on projects by missing a detail that was in the writeup. For this class </span><span class="c10 c40">especially</span><span class="c5">, make sure to check Piazza frequently for updates and clarification on the specifications for the project so that you don&rsquo;t lose points for dumb mistakes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Most of the difficulty comes from the nuances of working in C and familiarizing yourself with the codebase. If you need C help, go early in the week since office hours have to accommodate both 4410 and 4411 students. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">General tip to score well on projects: even though it may be tedious, try to write a very simple test for each functionality you implemented. While working in C, it is easy to cast to void pointers and lose all type information, so even correctly seeming code can be wrong because of a simple mistake. If you do this, </span><span class="c11 c40">and</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;make sure to cover every part of the project specifications, you will do very well in the class. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Though hailed as one of the more notorious of practicums, this course provides a very fulfilling experience. It will stress the importance of building and testing concurrently (not building, then testing), as well as trying to cover every possible corner case while trying your best to follow specifications.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Also for those who are curious, you CAN take CS 4411 as a standalone class, although if that is the case, then you should have taken CS 4410 prior to taking CS 4411.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c13" id="h.h6p2mg4wokvh"><span class="c8"><br>Alternatives to the Core Classes</span></h2>
    <h4 class="c44" id="h.j1b6mw2lok37"><span class="c27">CS 1112: Introduction to Computing Using MATLAB</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This is an alternate version of CS 1110 typically only taken by engineering students considering majors besides computer science. </span></p>
    <h4 class="c44" id="h.gvrkj7l8ydn1"><span class="c27">CS 2112: Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures - Honors</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This is the honors version of CS 2110. While the two courses cover approximately the same general topics, CS 2112 goes into greater depth with the material and has bigger and more challenging assignments. In particular, in CS 2112 you will learn more about algorithms and algorithm analysis on the theory side and about software design principles on the practical side.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The main difference from CS 2110, however, is in the projects. The coursework consists of several individual assignments followed by a final project spanning multiple assignments that you will work on with a partner for the remainder of the course. The assignments often involve implementing many of the data structures and algorithms covered in class. The final project also involves working with a partner in designing and managing a large codebase (thousands of lines of code) from scratch. These assignments are far heavier than the ones in CS 2110, so definitely consider the rest of your schedule and commitments before deciding to take this course. If you have the time to devote to this course though, you will learn a lot and also find yourself more equipped for the difficulty of upper-level CS courses.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">While projects from other introductory classes (CS 1110, CS 2110) focus more on getting familiar with the language and the fundamentals of programming, CS 2112 focuses more on object oriented design. Having a good design and working plan goes a long way. Talking to the TA&rsquo;s or the professor about your design will drastically reduce your work time. Make sure to devote enough time talking with your partner about design.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">This course can serve as an alternative to CS 3410 in terms of fulfilling the CS major&rsquo;s core requirement. Someone who has NOT taken ECE/ENGRD 2300 is strongly discouraged to take the course; otherwise, you will not have covered the same material that is covered in CS 3410, as you will miss out on learning the details of the building blocks of a CPU. In addition, ECE/ENGRD 2300 exposes students to assembly, which you are assumed to be familiar with at the beginning of CS 3420. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The topics covered include</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">A good amount of the material actually overlap with material that is taught in CS 4410 (around 30 to 50%, depending on how much material you are able to retain from CS 3420). </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Throughout the semester, you will be using the ARM FRDM-K64F board by NXP (MSP430 Development Tool by Texas Instruments was used in the past) for all of your labs. Labs consist of implementing concepts taught in class using C and loading the program to the chip and are done with partners. Historically, partners for Labs 1 - 4 are randomly assigned while you can choose your own partners for Labs 5 and 6. There are 6 total labs for the course&hellip;</span></p>

    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_kak6whk8tz6b-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Start your labs early! It is sometimes very hard to tell whether there is a bug in your code, so you might save yourself a lot of stress by making sure you have ample time to debug. This advice especially applies for the last two labs, which may seem a little rushed due to the proximity of finals season.</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">Try to review the material on a weekly basis to prepare yourself for the once-a-week i&gt;Clicker quiz! This will also help you prepare for the prelims. </span></li>
        <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c5">The professor particularly emphasizes that the prelims do not cover material that have not been discussed in class. Thus, it can be very helpful to go through the VideoNotes and lecture notes in preparation for the exams.</span></li>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Outside of courses, Cornell offers a variety of ways for students to get involved in the local computer science community through student computing groups. Joining one or more of these organizations is a great way for students to network with other computer science students as well as learn about different opportunities in the computer science field. These organizations also host many company info sessions, academic and career development workshops, guest speaker presentations, and other events that computer science students may find helpful (not to mention, there&rsquo;s usually free food and swag!).</span></p>
    <h2 class="c13" id="h.ruds2twsg2z9"><span class="c50">ACSU: </span><span class="c31">Association of Computer Science Undergraduates</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The Association of Computer Science Undergraduates, more commonly known as ACSU, is Cornell&rsquo;s chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). ACSU promotes educational, professional, and social interaction among students interested in computer science and facilitates student communication with faculty, alumni, and corporate representatives to enhance the undergraduate experience in computer science. Some things that ACSU oversees include social events for CS students to meet outside of class, student-faculty events, academic workshops to develop technical skills, company information sessions for recruitment, a resume book for internships and full-time employment, and a mentorship program. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span>Under-Represented Minorities in Computing (URMC) is an undergraduate organization with focus on providing guidance and community for UR minorities interested in majoring in any computing field (CS, InfoSci, ECE, Stats, etc). In spite of being an incredibly diverse school, computing fields at Cornell have a huge representation problem. Engineering CS for example, was only 6% hispanic, and 1% african-american in 2015. URMC aims to provide community, mentorship and career development opportunities specially targeted to URMs, but open to all students in the computing community, to bring minority students together, and provide a welcoming environment to solve this representation gap.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">The College of Engineering has over 20 project teams that allow students of all types of majors to gain hands-on, practical experience in their respective fields. While every project team has a different academic focus, most have some type of software subteam, and computer science students are encouraged to apply to any team that interests them. Computer science fields represented include but are not limited to mobile app development, web development, and software engineering. The general consensus is that students, especially freshmen, shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to apply if they have little to no prior experience working on a specific type of project, as many teams tend to accept based on potential and general knowledge of computer science.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c10">Note:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Recruitment for project teams generally occur in the very beginning of the semester (early September for Fall and late January/early February for Spring). Do your research early and don&rsquo;t miss the application deadlines (some project teams only recruit once a year)! </span></p>

    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Undergraduate research is a unique opportunity to reinforce topics you are learning about in class and to get experience working on real world projects. If you think you might want to pursue a PhD after graduating, then undergrad research experience is essential. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c13" id="h.33a1wu7fl7f1"><span class="c8">How to Find a Position</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">Finding research opportunities is a fairly painless process once you&rsquo;ve identified a field you&rsquo;re interested in. Cornell provides a </span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1505577505075000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4lf3xREOMpzvinXcPm5Zw6hTKpw">list</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;of faculty members in each field of computer science and a brief description of their work. If you find faculty members whose work you find interesting, navigate to their webpages and check out their papers to get an overview of the research they do. Send a short (1 - 2 paragraph) email with your resume to these faculty members that describes your background and why you&rsquo;re interested in their work. If all goes well, you&rsquo;ll be able to meet in person to discuss opportunities they have available for you. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c13" id="h.djlrvd3b443o"><span class="c8">Preparation</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">It&rsquo;s always a good idea to try to read the papers written by the faculty member you&rsquo;re working under, especially ones that are related to the work you&rsquo;ll be doing. You should ask which papers to read and the order in which you should read them. These papers will almost certainly be challenging to read since they&rsquo;re written for an audience of experts in the field, but faculty members are usually willing to walk you through the parts that you have trouble understanding.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c13" id="h.j7g9oiq4nrbp"><span class="c8">What Research is Like</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Research is unique from other opportunities available at the undergraduate level in that it is largely self-driven. While faculty members will give you a general overview of the project they want you to work on, they don&rsquo;t have time to constantly think of things for you to do. This gives you the freedom to set your own pace, but it also means that you&rsquo;re responsible for the progression of the project. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c13" id="h.a0sxii7ur44a"><span class="c8">Getting Credit</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11 c55">Research can be done either for course credit or (if the research group has sufficient resources) for pay. If you opt to take course credit it will appear on your transcript as CS 4999, which can be used to fill a technical elective. The CS department website describes the process in more detail </span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/uresch/registeringforcs4999&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1505577505076000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMTMA4NqxsPXW1pvVAxiQZBCG9CQ">here</a></span><span class="c5">.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Although the purpose of this README document is to provide an objective, unbiased introduction and overview of the major, we also thought it would be beneficial for students, especially underclassmen, to get personal insights from current CS majors of different grades. Note that these perspectives were provided by volunteers who wanted to contribute to the README so the contributors consisted of self-selected individuals, and therefore these testimonials may not be fully representative of the CS population at Cornell. Also note that these testimonials were collected from underclassmen (freshmen &amp; sophomores) due to our target audience. However, we hope that these shared experiences can help shed light on what being a CS major could potentially be like in the Cornell community. </span></p>

    <h2 class="c13" id="h.37czqj1z61c4"><span class="c8">Freshman A</span></h2>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c5">Coming in, I was pretty certain I was going to stick with CS as a major and taking more classes helped me solidify that decision. However, I was interested in many other fields and was struggling to choose a double major/minor. As of now I&#39;m leaning towards double majoring in Math and CS, which helped me decide to transfer to Arts and Sciences from Engineering because the Math major is not offered in the Engineering school. There&#39;s a lot of discussion about whether Arts or Engineering has a better environment for studying CS, but I personally thought being in Arts would be better in approaching the theoretical side of CS I want to explore. </span></p>
    <p class="c16 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c5">As of adjusting into the CS classes at Cornell, my first CS class was CS 2112, and it was very challenging for me because I&#39;m not a high caliber student and I didn&#39;t have any experience in CS except for my chill APCS class I took during high school. Sometime during the second assignment I panicked so hard I dropped the class and told my friend I&#39;m going to give up my CS major and become an AEP major. Then I decided to sit in CS 2110 and realized that I was actually enjoying CS 2112 a lot, so I added the class back in and somehow survived through it. It was definitely painful at times, but I ended up meeting so many talented and motivated people in the class, and I learned so much from the class itself and the people around me. I would definitely recommend to incoming freshmen CS majors to challenge themselves and dive into as many meme-worthy/difficult classes or activities as possible.</span></p>
    <p class="c16 c9 c17"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c5">Another thing I learned during freshman year was that lectures, office hours, and readings are actually pretty important. This applies to all classes but I think this is good to emphasize. In general, I&#39;m excessively lazy and fairly unmotivated, and that accompanied by my poor time management skills resulted in me skipping hilarious amounts of lectures, doing readings and assignments half-heartedly, and not going to office hours for the past year. Habits are hard to throw away so it&#39;s probably going to be a while for me to stop doing this, but I genuinely wish that I realized earlier how important being an earnest student is, especially in CS. </span></p>
    <p class="c16 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c5">Also, I was surprised to find how welcoming the CS community at Cornell was. There&#39;s a lot of diversity in our student population in comparison to other institutions, and I am always proud and happy to tell others that I am a CS major here. Although I have experienced only a year of Cornell so far, I haven&#39;t yet felt discriminated because of my gender as a female CS student, and I am grateful for the support for women in computing. Overall, I&#39;m glad that I chose Cornell for studying CS and I hope my remaining years are as, or more, academically intriguing and challenging as my freshman year has been.</span></p>
    <p class="c16 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c13" id="h.s4f73zac3qqy"><span class="c8">Freshman B</span></h2>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c5">My first experience with CS at Cornell was the CS Placement Exam that places you out of Python. I was a student that came to Cornell with little CS experience but was set on the major just because I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t like anything else. Fast forward and one year later, and my feelings are pretty much the same except that a bond of affection has replaced the indifference to CS (Stockholm syndrome at its finest). &nbsp;Since I passed the exam, I ended up taking 2110 and 2800 my first semester, which are pretty much the bread and butter (or maybe the flour and the milk that you use to make the bread and butter) of your CS curriculum. &nbsp;In retrospect, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter if you take these first or second semester. If you do not take them the first semester, take the time to adjust to Cornell and focus on other things since you will still have the time to take the classes without a rush the next semester. If you do end up taking the classes, be sure to spend an adequate amount of time on them as the concepts never go away, and the effort you put into a class and the challenges you face can benefit you in the long run. Since I was still adjusting to Cornell during that timeframe I did not understand the importance and the way prelims worked and how they affect your grades and therefore underperformed. I was then encouraged by my peers and closed out the semester with satisfactory results. What I learned the most out of that semester is that you should never be afraid to ask. Asking others for help, even professors, may seem scary at first but you soon come to realize that everyone who is around you wants you to succeed and is sometimes even willing to put in extra time to help. Even if you are starting a project the day it is due both professors and TA&rsquo;s are still willing to help you learn, as long as you yourself are willing to put in the effort. What I want to pass down is that you should know (or at least think you know) what you want to get out of your first year. In order to know what you want, you have to know what is available. Therefore, don&rsquo;t hesitate to find out, talk to people, go to events, and start building an answer to that question. Things are always easier when you have a realistic goal.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">I remember debating whether to take CS 1110 or CS 2110 my first semester at Cornell. Since I was pretty set on majoring in CS, I went ahead and signed up for CS 2110 because I thought affiliating as soon as possible was my best option. In retrospect, this wasn&#39;t the smartest decision I made. Not only did it not help me affiliate sooner, but I also missed out on a chance to learn Python. This obviously doesn&#39;t apply to you if you&#39;ve already mastered Python. If you, however, find yourself in a similar situation, just go ahead and take CS 1110. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Choose your CS partners wisely. Try to become partners with someone with good work ethic and communication skills. If you don&#39;t, you will spend countless nights of frustration and misery. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Join ACSU&#39;s mentorship program! My mentor told me about various opportunities available to freshmen and helped me decide which classes to take. It&#39;s also just nice to have someone older tell you about their experiences and perspectives. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Start assignments early. Go to office hours early. Study for prelims early. Procrastination is the cause of all bad GPAs. I thought I could pull off what I did in high school in college, but people here are way too smart for that. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">I personally was very self-conscious about my lack of experience and didn&#39;t apply to the programs oriented to underclassmen. Nobody cares that you applied and got rejected, so just apply to everything. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">My last advice is to make a lot of friends. Opportunities to make new friends dwindle as years go by, and you will regret it if you don&#39;t have friends. After all, CS is no fun if you don&#39;t have friends to complain about classes with.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">I decided to become a CS major my second semester freshman year, after I had taken 1110 and 2110 and loved it. Thus as a sophomore, I affiliated with the CS major. I handed in my affiliation form just before the summer, and was notified of acceptance at the start of my first semester sophomore year. Although it is not required that you affiliate with your major until the second semester of sophomore year, I felt it was convenient to affiliate early, as you will be able to get a CS advisor early on, and are allowed to pre-enroll in 4000 level classes that are open only to CIS students during pre-enroll.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">As for classes taken, once 2110 and 2800 are out of the way in Freshman year, a variety of 3000 and 4000 level classes are open. As an elective, I took CS 4320 and the practicum, CS 4321. At first it was very intimidating to sit in a 4000 level class as a Sophomore, but after a while I realized that courses have prerequisites for a reason, and once you meet those, it does not matter which year you are in the course, as you will already have the prior knowledge necessary to succeed in the course. However, the workload for 3000 and 4000 level classes are considerably larger than what I had experienced in freshman year, which took some time to get used to. In my second semester I took CS 3152, Intro to Game Design, which turned out to have the largest workload in all my classes, but also one of my favorite classes at Cornell. It was an awesome and rewarding experience. Personally, I feel that sophomore year is a year to knock off some core classes such as CS 3110 and 3410/3420, but also take some time to explore the great variety of 4000 level electives out there.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">I also took some time during sophomore year to explore TAing opportunities. I was a course consultant for both semesters, and found it very rewarding, because I get to help other students in their coursework, refresh my memory in the concepts that I might have forgotten from class, as well as learn how to explain my thoughts clearly to another person. I would highly recommend TAing some of your favorite classes if you like the class/professor, want to help others, or just want to make some money through this on-campus job. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Overall I find sophomore year a great year to explore opportunities, whether it is enrolling in some interesting 4000 level classes, diving into the internship search, trying out research, or TAing some classes to help your peers. It is your second year, when you are familiar with what Cornell has to offer, but do not have to worry about graduation yet. So make it count. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">It is quite hard to isolate my sophomore CS life from all I have been through at Cornell. I came to Cornell with undecided major and was truly overwhelmed by how many options are out there when I was a freshman. Trying to explore as many subjects as possible in the first year, I had my first CS course, CS 1110, in the spring semester and officially considered CS as a potential major on my list. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">Since I was quite determined to be an Economics major, Sophomore life for me was to explore more about CS, make sure if I&rsquo;m truly interested (because CS is not easy!) and balance the courses between Econ and CS. After taking the courses needed to declare the major, 2110 and 2800, I affiliated the major at the end of the first semester. Although CS advisor would not be assigned until the summer, I still found it better to affiliate early because students in CS major could more easily get the 4000 level course in pre-enroll period. Because I made up my mind to become a CS major in Sophomore year and hadn&rsquo;t taken a lot of courses before, I just stuck to the </span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="#h.rul7hzfgzniz">CS </a></span><span class="c7"><a class="c0" href="#h.rul7hzfgzniz">flowchart</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and only took one CS core class (CS 3410) in spring semester. Trying to plan my courses for Economics and CS, I also feel it is wise to decide the majors as early as possible for students with double or triple majors. It helps a lot to reasonably schedule the courses for all majors and college requirements later and to discuss with advisors or other faculty about your questions for future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">In general, I think sophomore year is for exploring and balancing. As an underclassman, I still had plenty of time to take courses I&rsquo;m interested in, explore academic activities and college life, and prepare for junior and senior years. Also, don&rsquo;t worry if you have any questions. There are always people willing to help. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">I already knew I was going to major in CS by the time I was a sophomore, but I had no idea which concentration to focus on, what electives to take, when I was going to take what class... But if I had one piece of advice, I would say definitely affiliate early! You won&#39;t necessarily get an advisor earlier, but you&#39;ll get the whole affiliating paperwork over and done with before your sophomore year really hits you hard, and you will have a leg up during pre-enroll if you want to get higher-level CS electives. And what you put down on your checklist won&#39;t lock you into a certain external specialization or vector--you can change it later very easily. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Affiliating early also helps you get your priorities straight, whether you realize you want to knock out the rest of your college requirements, or if you want to start taking more advanced classes right away. It helped me solidify my strategy going into sophomore year: try to get just one CS core class done per semester so I could really do well in it, finish off most of my engineering requirements, and try a couple of higher-level CS electives. Easier said than done, and I ended up making my sophomore year far too heavy credit-wise such that I was drowning in coursework for most of the time. But the silver lining to that is that I get to have lighter course loads for my next two years!</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">I guess freshman year, for me, was more about diving into college life and acclimating to a new academic work ethic; sophomore year was more about finding what is good (and really, really bad) for work-life balance. I got a lot more involved with my community, but I was also better at managing my own schedule. The resources and networks at Cornell and within Cornell&#39;s CS department are super helpful for getting advice on pretty much anything, so make sure to take advantage of it!</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">For me, the prospect of sophomore year was exciting because now that I had finished the basic intro courses in the CS major, I could take more advanced 3000-level courses as well as the entire range of 4000-level electives. I signed up a pretty heavy combination of CS core and elective classes, which was tough and kept me more busy than I ever was freshman year, especially since I had started interviewing with a few companies and needed time to prepare for that. It wasn&rsquo;t all bad though, because I still enjoyed spending most of my time taking CS courses that I was interested in rather than college requirements I just had to get done with. Two important things I learned this year:</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">1) Electives (both CS and non-CS) can be really unpredictable -- there were some that sounded cool but ended up dull, and there were some that I took on a whim and ended up loving, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to go out of your comfort zone and try something different</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">2) Definitely get out and get involved in activities outside of classes, but also realize that you can&rsquo;t do everything. Sort out what you want to prioritize and balance accordingly so you don&rsquo;t burn out.</span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c5">I started out comparatively late in computer science (after Freshman year). During my sophomore year, I was hesitant in trying out things because I thought I wasn&rsquo;t qualified to do them. I was also worried of me being &ldquo;late&rdquo; (after all, there are people in the CS department who start CS as early as elementary school). Now, though, I feel that no one really is &ldquo;late&rdquo; and all that matters is how much you do and how much you like what you are doing. If anyone is feeling &ldquo;late&rdquo; (I had a lot of friends who were in the same boat--one of my friends decided to major in CS in their junior year) rest assured that there is no such thing as &ldquo;late.&rdquo; Also, try to talk to as many people as possible and figure out what you need to do. Cool thing that happened to me--I talked to a random guy in my swimming class, and he turned out to be an intern at Microsoft. He told me what I needed to do and how to apply for internships (I didn&rsquo;t even know how a career fair worked!). The CS community is very large and diverse, so you can always find someone to ask for help.</span></p>
