        <p class="c1"><span class="c5">In one fateful winter break, a few students involved with Association
            for Computer Science Undergraduates (ACSU) wanted to provide a resource that not only addresses a
            handful of frequently asked questions but also serves as a more comprehensive guide to the Computer
            Science major at Cornell University than what the Unofficial CS Wiki offered. We hope that this guide
            will (1) serve as one of the many useful resources that underclassmen can use to acclimate to Cornell
            University as a CS major or minor and (2) be further improved by experienced upperclassmen who have
            accumulated helpful perspectives being in Cornell&rsquo;s CS community. </span></p>

        <h3 class="c35" id="h.sxxhtg9hqv8p"><span class="c6 c28">Are there any benefits of majoring in Computer Science
            through the College of Arts and Sciences instead of the College of Engineering, and vice versa?</span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">The general consensus for this question is that there is </span><span class="c13">no
            significant difference</span><span class="c1">. There appear to be a lot of students asking this, and most
            of
            them seem to have the wrong impression that majoring in one college over another is more
            &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo;; however, this is not the case. The only difference between the schools you major
            from is all of the requirements outside of the Computer Science major. For example, the College of
            Engineering requires students to take PHYS 1112 and 2213, whereas the College of A&amp;S does not. However,
            the College of A&amp;S requires students to take a language course and fulfill other
            &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; requirements. Yet, to complete the CS major, they need to take the same set of
            core classes (CS 2800, CS 3110, CS 3410/3420, CS 4410, CS 4820), 3 4000-level CS classes, 3 external
            specialization classes, and a few other requirements. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">It should also be noted that Engineering students graduate with a </span><span
            class="c13">Bachelor of Science</span><span class="c22">&nbsp;and Arts students graduate with a </span><span
            class="c13">Bachelor of Arts.</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some reasons that have been observed in the past to transfer from one school to
            another are the following:</span></p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <ul class="c9 lst-kix_7pgg30n2vrlt-0 start">
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">a student in CALS (or any other college), who does not have a CS major,
              transfers to CAS or CoE to earn a Computer Science major</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">a student with a lot of AP credits (say ones that fulfill PHYS 1112 and
              PHYS
              2213) cannot have them count towards graduation in one college (CAS), but can in another (CoE) </span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">a student does not want to fulfill a certain requirement (does not want to
              take a language class - go to CoE!, or hates Physics with an extreme passion - go to CAS!)</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">a student wants to double major in a field, but the second major is not
              offered in the particular college they are currently affiliated with (e.g. Mathematics is offered as a
              major in CAS but is not offered as a major in CoE) </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <h3 class="c35" id="h.c82ljgxztc58"><span class="c6 c28">Do I NEED a Mac? Can I get by with a PC? Will my
            choice
            of laptop affect my ability to become a Computer Science major? Which laptop would you recommend to a
            prospective CS major? </span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A CS major at Cornell University can DEFINITELY get by with either a PC or a
            Mac.
            If you have familiarity, Linux is also a perfectly workable option. Most classes use Virtual Machines to
            provide students with the required software that is needed for the class. For classes that don&rsquo;t,
            their
            course staff usually try their best to accommodate both. However, if you have interest in developing iPhone
            applications, a Mac is the way to go. A Mac is also nice in that it has a Unix environment, which makes
            many
            kinds of development easier. Bearing all these in mind, however, most people choose based on their personal
            preferences. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.39lsf5pg8yv8"><span class="c6 c28">I don&rsquo;t have prior CS knowledge; am I screwed?</span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not at all! Although it is common for students to have had exposure to Computer
            Science before their first year at Cornell, it is perfectly okay for students to have no prior experience
            whatsoever. In fact, introductory classes such as CS 1110 and CS 1112 are geared towards students with no
            prior background. There have been many students who excel as Computer Science majors at Cornell University
            who had no experience before college, and you can be one of them!</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.s9r7624sgy7g"><span class="c6 c28">When should I affiliate? What are the benefits of
            affiliating?</span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You should affiliate as soon as you are eligible if you have committed to the
            major. For most students, applying for affiliation occurs during sophomore year, but in some cases
            it&rsquo;s
            possible to affiliate even earlier. College of Engineering students have no choice but to apply before the
            end of sophomore year or they will be withdrawn from the college, but CAS students are free to begin the
            process during their fourth semester. You submit the paperwork to affiliate during the semester that you
            take
            the last of the required courses.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The requirements for affiliation are as follows:</span></p>
        <ul class="c9 lst-kix_ded4jiex5pw-0 start">
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">cumulative GPA &gt;= 2.0 (CoE-only requirement)</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">at least a C in all completed CS and math courses</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">GPA &gt;= 2.5 in CS 2110/2112 and CS 2800</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">GPA &gt;= 2.5 in MATH 1120/1220/1920 and CS 2800</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">If you don&rsquo;t meet these requirements, don&rsquo;t despair! Some
            deficiencies can be offset by excelling in other areas. Check out the </span><span class="c14"><a class="c3"

              Major website</a></span>
          <span class="c1">&nbsp;for more information. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s definitely good to affiliate by your third semester if you can; if
            you
            can&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry too much about it. One of the few differences the timing can make is in
            pre-enrolling for fourth semester classes. Many 4000+ level CS courses are available only to CS/IS majors
            during pre-enroll, so there is a slight advantage to sophomores who are already affiliated by then. More
            perks that are offered to CS majors are access to the undergraduate computing lab (UGClab) in Gates G33,
            official access to the CIS undergraduate lab (although the door is usually open anyway), and CS-related
            emails from the awesome Nicole Roy!</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Double majoring for the sake of double majoring is not the best idea. You
            should
            do this only if you have vested interest in both subjects! Note that the Computer Science major offers good
            opportunities for you to explore other subject areas through the External Specialization requirements, many
            university-wide minors and probably </span>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is definitely good to decide the double majors as early as possible
            (especially
            with Computer Science) because then you can plan the courses ahead and don&rsquo;t have to panic as you
            become an upperclassman. </span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For students with Computer Science major in College of Arts and Sciences, you

        <h3 class="c35" id="h.2q3hh8dfm6el"><span class="c6 c28">Should I take CS 1110 or CS 1112?</span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">CS 1110 teaches you the basics of Computer Science in using the Python
            programming
            language, whereas CS 1112 teaches you the basics using the Matlab language. Because writing code in Python
            is
            less complex, more readable, and is easier to transition to learn how to write code in other popular
            languages such as Java, most prospective CS majors elect to take CS 1110. However, CS 1112 would be a good
            choice for students who are interested in classes associated with Computational Science &amp; Engineering
            (CS
            4210, CS 4220) or have interest in other science fields outside of Computer Science because it is useful
            for
            mathematical computations. </span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.1sd1bbo5y6ub"><span class="c6 c28">Should I take CS 2110 or CS 2112?</span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Both courses cover similar material. However, CS 2112 is well-known for its
            extensive projects. If you are looking to getting experience on working on a significant codebase and have
            the time to afford to, CS 2112 might be the course for you. Also there is an option to switch back to CS
            2110
            from CS 2112 within the first three weeks, so if you find the assignments and the overall pace of CS 2112
            to
            be a bit much, switching back to CS 2110 is always an option.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that said, CS 2110 also covers a significant breadth of material, and by
            the
            end of it, students should be exposed to a variety of technical concepts that are not only covered in other
            higher-level CS courses but also prepare students to begin preparing for technical interviews. So in terms
            of
            the material covered, students enrolled in CS 2110 are not missing out on anything significant. For
            students
            who have taken CS 2110, they are generally able to invest more time into other courses as well, as CS
            2110&rsquo;s projects are not on the scale of CS 2112. </span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.dsusaqhy96wq"><span class="c6 c28">Should I take CS 3410 or CS 3420 / ECE 3140?</span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This answer partially depends on whether you can fit ENGRD/ECE 2300 (a
            prerequisite for 3420) into your schedule. Because CS majors in the College of Engineering are required to
            take 2 engineering distributions, ENGRD/ECE 2300 is a popular choice due to its material being most
            relevant
            to the CS major out of other ENGRD options (the other being filled by ENGRD 2110 or ENGRD 2112, which is
            required for the major). If you can manage to fit ENGRD/ECE 2300 into your schedule and want to avoid
            overlapping content, taking CS 3420 (crosslisted as ECE 3140) may be the better option. However, if you
            want
            to reinforce the material taught in ENGRD/ECE 2300, taking CS 3410 might be better. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now that CS 3410 is offered in both the Fall and the Spring, fitting that into
            your schedule is much more flexible than trying to fit in CS 3420, which is offered only in the Spring
            semester. If this is of concern to you, taking CS 3410 might be a better option.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In terms of comparing the courses themselves, CS 3410 is pretty well known to be
            filled with projects that are very time consuming. CS 3420 on the other hand have very reasonable projects
            up
            until the final project (open-ended), in which the time commitment can vary wildly depending on the type of
            projects students wish to pursue. CS 3410 also squeezes in a lot more material than CS 3420 does. This,
            however, is more like comparing to apples to oranges, as the combination of ENGRD 2300 and CS 3420 covers
            all
            the material covered by CS 3410 and more. In that sense, if you want to spread out the material you want to
            learn in the duration of a year rather than the semester, the ENGRD 2300-CS 3420 might be of more interest
            (and vice versa).</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lastly, CS 3420 places more emphasis on I/O and hardware-related material (hence
            its name, Embedded Systems). In fact, most projects in CS 3420 involve coding logic onto a microcontroller
            (MSP430). This is highlighted by the final project which gives student freedom to pursue whatever project
            they wish to with their MSP430s. Therefore, if you have more interest in hardware systems, CS 3420 might be
            for you. </span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.qb87fwi5wdll"><span class="c6 c28">What is a practicum? What separates it from a regular
            course?</span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">With the exception of CS 2111, practicums are classes that are based entirely on
            projects. Usually, given a class CS xxx0, its associated practicum will be offered as CS xxx1. Every CS
            major
            is required to take one practicum, and can choose to enroll in multiple practicums if they wish. The
            practicums are meant to be extensions of the associated course, and usually students get to implement a
            variety of things covered in lecture but are not explored in other parts of the class. For example, for CS
            4320: Intro to Database Systems, lectures encompass various components of databases, and in CS 4321,
            students
            get to implement a SQL-interpreter in Java where they actually code up and learn the ins-and-outs of the
            discussed components. For some classes, the practicum must be taken along with the actual course (e.g. CS
            4120 + 4121).</span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.40cndcnr3isn"><span class="c6 c28">Why are some 4000-level classes cross-listed as
            5000-level classes? </span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If a 4000-level class is cross-listed as a 5000-level class, that means that the
            same course is offered to both undergraduate students and graduate students. Therefore, unless you are a
            graduate student, you should sign up for the 4000-level class as CS 4xxx instead of CS 5xxx. The class and
            all requirements are generally the exact same.</span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.vtc15ce4grba"><span class="c6 c28">What is a vector? Is it important in any way? Is one
            more prestigious than another? </span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Think of vectors as a guideline of which courses to take if you are interested
            in
            a certain subject (like a </span><span class="c22 c25">concentration</span><span class="c22">). Fulfilling
            a
            vector is optional, but note that vector requirements can double count. Outside of the context of Cornell
            Computer Science, vectors are not too important and don&rsquo;t even show up on your transcript. However,
            they can be very useful in trying to shape your future coursework and determine which courses to take. Keep
            in mind that vectors are not hard requirements as much as they are a checklist of courses, so a class taken
            as a CS major requirement </span>
          <span class="c13">can</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;double count as a vector requirement. </span></p>

        <h3 class="c35" id="h.dcuflkxo89wj"><span class="c6 c28">What are prerequisites? Are they actually enforced?
          </span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Many courses build off the material in prior courses, either directly or
            indirectly. In order to ensure that all students have the same background, departments designate certain
            other courses as prerequisites that must be completed before enrolling in a subsequent course. Historically
            the CS department has allowed students to take classes for which they did not have the prerequisites,
            though
            doing so is not recommended. If you do not meet the prerequisites for a certain course it is recommended
            that
            you speak with the instructor, since sometimes they serve only as a way to ensure that you have some
            previous
            experience with the topic.</span></p>
        <h3 class="c35" id="h.xmvmdcjllequ"><span class="c6 c28">I am struggling as a CS major, and I need additional
            resources for help; how can I go about doing this? </span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you are struggling with a particular CS class, the first approach would be to
            try to go to Office Hours and seek help from TAs. Professors will generally also hold an hour or two of
            office hours, but if they are at a time you can&rsquo;t make then free to try to arrange a meeting with a
            professor by catching them after class or through e-mail. Professors and TAs are here to help your learning
            experience, and can be surprisingly helpful in pinpointing the source of your struggles. In some cases,
            Professors may help find you a personal tutor for the course. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">In addition to the course staff, introductory classes have external resources
            that can help. For example, CS 1110, CS 1112, and CS 2110 all have on-call</span><span class="c14"><a class="c3"

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The nice thing about Computer Science is that a lot of information can be found
            online as well. If you don&rsquo;t understand a certain concept presented in lecture and staring at the
            slides doesn&rsquo;t help, Googling for understanding can yield surprisingly helpful resources. Stack
            Overflow is especially useful.</span></p>

        <h3 class="c42" id="h.ysm1xz7cgu02"><span class="c6 c28">For the checklist requirements, can I replace CHEM
            2080
            with any other class? </span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">CHEM 2080 can be replaced by BTRY 3080, ECON 3130, MATH 2930, MATH 4710, PHYS
            2214, or PHYS 2218. However keep in mind the MATH 2930 is a prerequisite of PHYS 2214. </span></p>

            for
            the CS checklist? </span></h3>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, you cannot have the same class listed for any of the requirements
            that require you to fill in the class name, semester you took it, and your grade. For example you cannot
            use
            MATH 2930 to replace both CHEM 2080 as well as use it as a Technical Elective. However, you can use a
            statistic/probability class for a requirement on a checklist. For example you can use ENGRD 2700 as a
            probability class as well as an ENGRD requirement (because the probability class is only a checkbox. As
            long
            as you took one, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which class it is or whether it satisfies another requirement.)

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">An external specialization is three 3000+ classes that are all related in some
            way. The easiest way to complete an external spec would be to find three class in the same category (MATH,
            CHEM, MECHE, ECE etc) that are 3000 or above. You could also have a very thin connection between the three
            classes. As long as you&rsquo;re able to explain how those three classes are connected, then anything is
            valid. </span></p>

            or
            in any quantitative way qualify. They are usually in application areas such as BIO, BEE, CHEM, PSYCH, PHYS,
            MATH, ECON, any Engineering fields including CS and MAE, or related subjects. However, some of these areas
            may involve writing or theoretical courses, such as PSYCH 3050 (theory). No classes that involve writing
            only
            about science, math, technology, etc, qualify.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Internships are a great way for students to explore potential career paths and

            developer is like in the real world. People usually apply for internships through the career fair and

            class="c22">. This is not the only means, however, as most companies have links on their websites
            specifically for internships applications. Generally, an applicant needs to fill out basic information
            about
            themselves as well as a resume that highlights their technical skills, coursework, and achievements. If you
            perform well at an internship, most companies will give a </span>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Typically after a brief conversation to introduce yourself, most Software
            Engineering internship positions will require the candidate to solve one or more technical interview
            questions. This will most of the time involve concepts introduced in CS 2110/2. Depending on the set up,
            this
            is usually done on the whiteboard (in-person interview) or on a website that provides code-friendly
            platform
            (phone interview). A sample question can be something like:</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">These classes are required for anyone majoring in computer science. With the
            exception of CS 2110 and CS 2800 (which are often taken together), it is generally recommended that
            students
            should take one core class each semester. However, that isn&rsquo;t to say taking more than one (say, CS
            4820
            and CS 3410) is impossible. See the Alternatives to the Core Classes section below for alternate classes,
            and

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The first course in the computer science sequence, this is a recommended course
            to
            take for all newcomers. It will cover all the necessary skills that every coder has with them, from
            variables
            to functions and beyond. Can be waived with AP Computer Science credit (may vary in CAS and CoE
            departments,
            however).</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The class is historically taught by Walker White in the fall and then a pair of
            professors in the Spring. Because the Spring curriculum is based off Professor Walker&rsquo;s personally
            designed Fall curriculum, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any major differences in taking it in either semester.
            Also because it is an introductory class into the CS world, the class tends to have a large number of
            consultants whose jobs are also to give advice and insight into the rest of the CS major. There are
            one-on-one meetings designed into the class for any questions you may have, so make sure to take advantage
            of
            those resources if you need them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The projects are very straightforward and as long as you&rsquo;re paying
            attention
            in class/lab and reading instructions carefully, you&rsquo;ll do well. The most noteworthy project is the
            last one where you&rsquo;ll be tasked to build your own version of Breakout. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Projects can be done in pairs of two or alone. While it might be beneficial to
            have a partner to talk with, be careful in dividing up work--since this is an introductory class, you
            definitely want to get good grasp of the course material.</span></p>

            class.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This class has a lighter amount of work compared to other CS classes. There are
            seven projects which can be completed with a partner. There are two prelims and an optional final. Grades
            in
            homeworks are typically very high (~90) while prelim grades follow a normal distribution (average between
            65
            and 75). This means that prelims are weighted heavily when deciding grades, so study up.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The course consists of lectures as well as but also two weekly recitations
            taught

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This course, like CS 3410, is a significant jump in difficulty/workload from CS

            haven&rsquo;t gotten into this habit already. There are usually 5-7 projects that consist mostly of
            programming in OCaml. In the past, the course has varied with regards to working with partners. Last time
            it
            was taught by Constable, for example, it featured mostly individual projects; only one was in pairs. There
            has also been semesters where all projects were pair or group projects. In Clarkson last offering the first
            few projects were individual, while the next few were (optionally) done with a partner, and the final
            project
            was a group project (mandatory) with 3-4 team members. Historically, this final project allows each group
            more freedom in their software engineering choices, but also expects much more creativity and ingenuity to
            come from the assignment.</span></p>

            such as computer organization, systems programming, and hardware/software interface. In terms of the work,
            you are required to work individually for some of the projects and in a pair for others. The labs are done
            individually. You may also have written homeworks depending on which professor is teaching the course.</span></p>

            program
            called Logisim, which is used to build circuits. You will get familiarized with Logisim through PA1, where
            you will build an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic calculations. In PA2 and PA3, you
            will
            build a functioning five-stage MIPS processor that executes various instructions. PA3 builds on PA2 but is
            considered to be harder than PA2 since it can be tricky to figure out all the edge cases. PA4 is a friendly
            hacking challenge which requires you to craft some input to a simplified browser and cause it to print out
            a
            different message as its default one. You will essentially be performing a buffer overflow attack on the
            browser. The last projects, PA5-6, involve writing tests for dynamic memory allocator (malloc) in C and
            then
            implementing malloc. A lot of problems arise due to the fact that students are still unfamiliar with
            commons

            the
            class are important to master for any choice of career in CS. The course is also good to know for CS 4410
            (Operating Systems), since the material continues approximately where 3410 left off and students use the

            Miniprojects (MPs). Even if you are signed up for CS 4411, there will usually be 1 or 2 MPs you are still
            required to do. In the past, there have generally been
            4 MPs on the following topics:</span>
        </p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The projects themselves aren&rsquo;t too difficult. The first one will be very
            helpful for preparing for the first prelim and provide students exposure to synchronization questions. For
            the rest, try to read over the writeup for the projects very carefully, as even overlooking a minor detail
            may cost you a significant amount of points, especially as grading for many of the assignments is
            completely
            decided by the autograder test cases. Never break the 12 commandments of synchronization!</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Another general advice for the MPs would be to try to sketch out what you will
            be
            doing before actually implementing the code. Although this is a general advice that can apply to virtually
            any CS class, this is especially important in OS when you have to, say, implement a protocol that will be
            designed to respond in a specific manner depending on the context. </span></p>

            don&rsquo;t take too much time. However, obtaining a good understanding may take some time, so don&rsquo;t
            put it off until the last minute. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to clarify any details that you have with the
            writeup

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The course has weekly problem sets that usually consists of three problems (two
            on
            a short week). Almost all of the problems involve (1) coming up with an algorithm to solve the problem of
            interest (2) write a proof to explain why the algorithm you proposed solves the problem (3) reason about
            runtime when applicable. Starting Spring 2016, some problem sets actually included a problem that involved
            coding in Java. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some helpful advice for the class includes&hellip;</span></p>
        <ul class="c9 lst-kix_d4dwwtv1lqtk-0 start">
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">the textbook, written by Cornell professors (Eva Tardos and Jon Kleinberg)
              is super comprehensive and is structured just like the lectures. If you ever had to buy a textbook, this
              would be the most helpful one in terms of how much it will actually help you with the class</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">even if you plan to put off doing the problem set until a later time, try
              to
              read the problems as soon as they are released. Just thinking about the problems in your downtime can
              save
              a lot of time when you actually get down to doing it</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">if you haven&rsquo;t used LaTeX much up until this point&hellip; be
              prepared! Sometimes typing up your answers can take longer time than actually doing the problem, so make
              sure to always leave enough time to type </span></li>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c13">Workload: </span><span class="c1">The best description of the workload for CS
            4820 is constant. With weekly problem sets, there is not much downtime of not actually having something
            due.
            Once you start using your late days as well, you may end up in a situation where you have to do 2 problem
            sets in one week&hellip;</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Weekly supplemental class for CS 2110; credited S/U. This course does NOT
            fulfill
            the CS project requirement despite being called a practicum. Usually is taught by the course instructor(s)
            and delves deeper into topics covered in recent CS 2110 lectures. Before exams, it can also double as a
            review or Q&amp;A session. </span></p>

        <h4 class="c27" id="h.ucwxcow53fc3"><span class="c26 c16">CS 4411: Practicum in Operating Systems</span></h4>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For this class, you and your partner will be graded solely on the 6 projects
            that
            you work on throughout the semester. All of the projects are written in C, and each take a considerable
            amount of time (Heavy workload). Each project delves deeper into a topic that was briefly introduced in the
            lecture, which gives you a deeper understanding of the material. If you take this class, you have to do
            only
            the first Mini Project (MP) for OS and can ignore the other ones. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">The projects are estimated to be around 30-40 hours of work, but they are
            spaced
            out 2-3 weeks apart. Note that the first 4 projects build on each other. If you have a mistake on project
            1,
            you must fix it before you turn in project 2 or else you will lose points. Or even worse, you will run into
            a
            huge error later down the line. More often, significant points are lost on projects by missing a detail
            that
            was in the writeup. For this class </span>
          <span class="c13 c25">especially</span><span class="c1">, make sure to check Piazza frequently for updates
            and
            clarification on the specifications for the project so that you don&rsquo;t lose points for dumb mistakes.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most of the difficulty comes from the nuances of working in C and familiarizing
            yourself with the codebase. If you need C help, go early in the week since office hours have to accommodate
            both 4410 and 4411 students. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">General tip to score well on projects: even though it may be tedious, try to
            write a very simple test for each functionality you implemented. While working in C, it is easy to cast to
            void pointers and lose all type information, so even correctly seeming code can be wrong because of a
            simple
            mistake. If you do this, </span>
          <span class="c22 c25">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;make sure to cover every part of the project
            specifications, you will do very well in the class. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Though hailed as one of the more notorious of practicums, this course provides a
            very fulfilling experience. It will stress the importance of building and testing concurrently (not
            building,
            then testing), as well as trying to cover every possible corner case while trying your best to follow
            specifications.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Also for those who are curious, you CAN take CS 4411 as a standalone class,
            although if that is the case, then you should have taken CS 4410 prior to taking CS 4411.</span></p>

        <h4 class="c27" id="h.j1b6mw2lok37"><span class="c26 c16">CS 1112: Introduction to Computing Using MATLAB</span></h4>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is an alternate version of CS 1110 typically taken only by engineering
            students considering majors besides computer science. </span></p>
        <h4 class="c27" id="h.gvrkj7l8ydn1"><span class="c26 c16">CS 2112: Object-Oriented Design and Data Structures -
            Honors</span></h4>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is the honors version of CS 2110. While the two courses cover approximately
            the same general topics, CS 2112 goes into greater depth with the material and has bigger and more
            challenging assignments. In particular, in CS 2112 you will learn more about algorithms and algorithm
            analysis on the theory side and about software design principles on the practical side.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The main difference from CS 2110, however, is in the projects. The coursework
            consists of several individual assignments followed by a final project spanning multiple assignments that
            you
            will work on with a partner for the remainder of the course. The assignments often involve implementing
            many
            of the data structures and algorithms covered in class. The final project also involves working with a
            partner in designing and managing a large codebase (thousands of lines of code) from scratch. These
            assignments are far heavier than the ones in CS 2110, so definitely consider the rest of your schedule and
            commitments before deciding to take this course. If you have the time to devote to this course though, you
            will learn a lot and also find yourself more equipped for the difficulty of upper-level CS courses.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">While projects from other introductory classes (CS 1110, CS 2110) focus more on
            getting familiar with the language and the fundamentals of programming, CS 2112 focuses more on object
            oriented design. Having a good design and working plan goes a long way. Talking to the TA&rsquo;s or the
            professor about your design will drastically reduce your work time. Make sure to devote enough time talking
            with your partner about design.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This course can serve as an alternative to CS 3410 in terms of fulfilling the CS
            major&rsquo;s core requirement. Someone who has NOT taken ECE/ENGRD 2300 is strongly discouraged to take
            the
            course; otherwise, you will not have covered the same material that is covered in CS 3410, as you will miss
            out on learning the details of the building blocks of a CPU. In addition, ECE/ENGRD 2300 exposes students
            to
            assembly, which you are assumed to be familiar with at the beginning of CS 3420. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A good amount of the material actually overlap with material that is taught in
            CS
            4410 (around 30 to 50%, depending on how much material you are able to retain from CS 3420). </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Throughout the semester, you will be using the ARM FRDM-K64F board by NXP
            (MSP430
            Development Tool by Texas Instruments was used in the past) for all of your labs. Labs consist of
            implementing concepts taught in class using C and loading the program to the chip and are done with
            partners.
            Historically, partners for Labs 1 - 4 are randomly assigned while you can choose your own partners for Labs
            5
            and 6. There are 6 total labs for the course&hellip;</span></p>

            FRDM-K64F
            board and typically involves applying some concepts from previous labs and lectures. Just like with the
            labs,
            the final project can be done with a partner. Additionally, each group will be assigned a mentor to help
            out
            with any questions regarding the project.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The course also has a few written homeworks that are graded pass/fail based on
            if
            you get 60% of it right, but they require little to no time to complete. Once a week, there will be a short
            i&gt;Clicker quiz as well covering the topics lectured from the previous week. </span></p>

        <ul class="c9 lst-kix_n47kuyjtypp7-0 start">
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">Start your labs early! It is sometimes very hard to tell whether there is
              a
              bug in your code, so you might save yourself a lot of stress by making sure you have ample time to debug.
              This advice especially applies for the last two labs, which may seem a little rushed due to the proximity
              of finals season.</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">Try to review the material on a weekly basis to prepare yourself for the
              once-a-week i&gt;Clicker quiz! This will also help you prepare for the prelims. </span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">The professor particularly emphasizes that the prelims do not cover
              material
              that have not been discussed in class. Thus, it can be very helpful to go through the VideoNotes and
              lecture notes in preparation for the exams.</span></li>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this course, students are assigned into groups of 6 containing programmers
            and
            designers at the very start of the semester, and work within that team to build a fully fledged desktop
            PC/Mac game that will enter the annual GDIAC Showcase at the end of the semester.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lectures for the course cover both design and programming elements of computer
            game development, and serves as a useful resource for designing and building the game. For the first month
            while brainstorming game ideas, programmers and designers all must complete a series of 4 labs designed to
            teach you basic programming or designing techniques. The game is built using Java and the LibGDX framework.
            Art assets are generally created via Adobe Photoshop. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the first month, there will be 7 milestones, with each one typically
            taking
            two weeks. The major milestones are: Non-digital Prototype, Gameplay Prototype, Technical Prototype, Alpha
            Release, Beta Release, Final Release, GDIAC Showcase. For each milestone, you will estimate what you will
            do
            for the milestone, demonstrate the milestone&rsquo;s work in class or in labs, reflect on whether you met
            the
            goals for this milestone, and receive detailed feedback as well as suggestions moving forward from the

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This course must also be taken with the 1 credit ENGRC 3152 course. Therefore,
            there are also document writing throughout the course. For every two week sprint, there will be a two week
            report. Other documents include the Concept Document, Gameplay Specification, Architecture Specification,
            Design Specification, and Game Manual. These documents will typically undergo three rounds of revision,

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because this is a very serious course where approximately 10 hours of work per

          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">Take the labs seriously and use them as a guideline to learn. A lot of the
              programming part is based heavily on some of the labs, and you are free to use any lab code. Knowing the
              labs well will make your lives easier when developing the game. For designers, the labs are great
              tutorials
              to help you get familiar with photoshop (if you are not already so) on digital art and animation. </span></li>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this course, students are divided into interdisciplinary teams of six
            students,
            comprised of both programmers and designers. Team members must work together throughout the semester to
            build
            a fully-fledged cross-platform mobile game that will enter the annual GDIAC Showcase. Devices are useful
            but
            not required; some students may be interested in purchasing a cheap Android phone or iPod touch for
            development purposes.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lectures for the course cover both design and programming as applied to computer
            game development. There are no labs. Games are built using C++ and Cocos2d-x, while art assets are
            generally
            created via Adobe Photoshop.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The semester is split into several milestones, with each one typically taking
            two
            weeks. These include various prototypes (Non-digital, Gameplay, Technical) and releases (Alpha, Closed
            Beta,
            Open Beta, Showcase). Each milestone requires careful planning and sizing; at sprint&rsquo;s end, teams can
            expect to receive detailed feedback from the course staff and an opportunity for self-evaluation.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This course must also be taken with the 1-credit ENGRC 4152. Therefore, document
            writing is an integral part of the class; for every two-week sprint, there will also be a two-week report.
            Other assigned documents include the Concept Document, Gameplay Specification, Architecture Specification,
            Design Specification, and App Store Proposal. These documents will typically undergo several rounds of
            revision, in which the last version turned in will earn the final grade for the document.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the GDIAC Showcase, your game will be presented to the public. This counts as
            the final exam for the course, with audience reception factored into a game&rsquo;s final grade. GDIAC
            attendees vote for their favorite games, and awards in various categories are distributed at the end of the
            Showcase.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because this is an intensive course where approximately 10 hours of work
            per-person per-week are expected, prospective students must apply and be approved by Professor Walker White
            before enrolling. Applications are also used as the basis for team assignments, which are made by Professor

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this class, students work together in groups of 5-6 to build a browser-based
            game, gathering information over the course of the semester through logging players&rsquo; actions and
            using
            it to improve the game over several iterations. Groups typically consist of 1 or 2 designers, and 4
            programmers. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lectures combine basic elements of game design with topics on data gathering for
            games. Game design topics taught include learnability and user interfaces, procedural content generation,
            balancing, and level design. Students will also learn how to collect data and make conclusions based on it
            to
            improve their game.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The games are typically written in Flash/HTML5, and have in the past always been
            2D games. There are five milestones in total, spaced out approximately every 1.5 weeks. The last two
            milestones are public, and consist of releasing to Newgrounds and Kongregate respectively. Most games will
            receive at least 1,000 views.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">After each milestone, groups present to the class on the data they gathered, as
            well as any conclusions they drew from this data. For example, a group may notice a steep dropoff in the
            number of players that pass a certain level, and talk about why this might be the case and how they can fix
            it. In at least one milestone, students must also perform an A/B test on a release of their games.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Students who are interested should expect to spend at least 10 hours a week on
            this class. In addition, students will need to meet with their group often - the most successful games in
            this class are built by groups that communicate and work together effectively.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This class is sometimes compared with CS-3152/4152; its format draws influence
            from these classes. Games in the analytics-driven class are slightly smaller in scope than those of the
            other
            game design courses, due to the emphasis on iterating on gameplay through analytics. In addition, lectures
            in
            this class overlap slightly with CS-3152, though most lectures are specific to this class. The class format
            is also fairly similar, with some class periods reserved for playtesting.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Previous game design experience is recommended, but not required, for both
            programmers and designers. In addition to the prerequisites listed below, some knowledge of MySQL for
            programmers is also helpful but not required. Designers should have some art and animation experience.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">This course gives an introduction to the field of generating images using
            computers and provides a foundation for pursuing the subject more advanced and specific areas like animated
            films and video games. The course starts with the basic building blocks of representing a three-dimensional
            scene, including object meshes, perspective, lighting, and transformations in space, and then goes on to
            rendering techniques like ray tracing and rasterization through the graphics pipeline. Finally, subjects
            such
            as curves, textures, animation, and other advanced topics are covered. The course involves a decent amount
            of
            mathematics, including mostly linear algebra with a little bit of calculus, and prior knowledge is not a
            prerequisite but of course would be helpful.<br><br>There are generally around 7 projects (under Professor
            Bala), covering object meshes, basic ray tracing, scene rendering, shaders in GLSL, splines, animation, and
            advanced ray tracing. Projects consist of a programming part (done with a partner) and a written part (done
            alone). The written parts are usually a few questions designed to reinforce the theory taught in class.
            Programming assignments are done in Java and come with skeleton code as well as the course-created Java
            graphics framework. These are straightforward for the most part, as most of it is just translating the
            procedures or mathematics they describe into code. However, it is easy to make minor mistakes that are
            often
            very difficult to debug due to the nature of the subject, as you generally have few references other than
            the
            generated image to troubleshoot the problem, so it is important to be careful when programming and to
            really
            understand the theory before tackling the implementation. The course Java framework, although constantly
            being improved by the TAs, can also be buggy at times or counterintuitive if you&#39;re not careful, so
            read
            the specs carefully. Programming assignments are graded in scheduled demo sessions and are evaluated mostly
            visually based on the end result rather than through automated test cases.<br><br>There is also a midterm
            and
            a final, which along with the programming and written assignments encompass graded material in the course.<br><br></span>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This course covers a breadth of subjects about digital images starting from the
            level of an unfamiliar beginner and then builds up to more complex techniques. Students first learn about
            how
            an image is made up (image representation, filtering, fourier analysis) and then dive into the fundamental
            theories and techniques used in the field (feature detection, image transformations, single view modeling,
            stereo view modeling, structure from motion), and finally it finishes off with a strong focus in deep
            neural
            networks (Convnets, object recognition, face recognition, scene categorization), which have recently become

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is a project-based course, with students expected to complete roughly 5-6
            projects and 2-3 homeworks over the course of the semester. The projects focus on the actual implementation
            of the theories learned in class. In previous semesters (Professor Bala), students have implemented their
            own
            panorama generating program, programs to recover 3D geometry of objects given 2D images, and constructed
            their own convolutional neural networks for image recognition.</span></p>

            homeworks. These assignments are nontrivial for the most part, and cover much of the material that will be
            tested during the exams. There are two exams: the midterm and the final, which account for the bulk of your
            grade, and feature questions similar to those you&rsquo;ve seen in the homeworks. In the past, class
            participation (questions/answers and comments during class) was also included as a mandatory part of your
            grade, but was changed to an optional extra-credit in Fall 2016 due to the size of the class.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This course is an introductory course to Natural Language Processing (as the
            name
            clearly suggest). It teaches how computers use human languages as inputs, outputs, or both and covers
            parsing, machine translation, grammar induction, and information retrieval. Basically the course is about
            how
            computers can take human language and understand it. (Very very basic concepts of parsing and grammar
            induction were taught in CS 2800 and CS 2110 so the ideas might seem familiar.) </span></p>

            want to be the one carrying. These projects are split up into two parts. The second part is usually the
            heavier part of the project, but you get feedback for part 1 to help you. Part 1 is mainly creating

            learning models, and is focused on theory and proofs of why these models work. This gives the students the
            ability to reason about in what situations certain models can be advantageous. In addition, students get to
            implement/debug each of these models themselves in order to figure out the nuances, which helps build a
            stronger intuition of how they work. This class does not focus heavily on the applications of machine

        </section>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was drawn to computer science in high school when I learned Java by watching
            online
            videos and C by solving problems in a programming book. So I entered college knowing clearly that I would
            pursue
            a major in CS.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">With my AP credit I skipped the introductory CS course, and faced the hard
            decision of
            choosing between CS 2110 and CS 2112. I first read the ACSU README to have a general idea of the
            differences
            between the two courses in terms of course material and workload. Next, I contacted students who had
            already
            taken the courses for advice, and finally made up my mind to try CS 2112 because I wanted to challenge
            myself
            during my first semester of college and also to gain more experience in building and maintaining a large
            codebase.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since I had added CS 2112 to my course list and knew that it would take up a
            large
            portion of my time, I decided not to take too many credits during my first semester. The other CS class
            that
            I
            took was CS 2800, which turned out to be a nice course to take together with CS 2112. 2112 was
            project-based,
            whereas 2800 was problem-set-based and basically involved writing mathematical proofs and solving problem
            sets.
            So this combination was a good one, as I could have a nice balance between writing code and solving problem
            sets.
            Besides, another advantage of taking them at the same time was that with those two taken, I could select CS
            classes more freely for my second semester, because CS 2800 teaches fundamental concepts in CS and thus is
            a
            prerequisite for many electives.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In terms of the learning experience, CS 2112 truly deserved its reputation as a
            hard
            class. The eight homework projects were challenging, especially the last four of them, which together
            constituted
            a large project of more than 10,000 lines of code. However, the professor and the teaching assistants were
            all
            extremely experienced and helpful, and I found that the homework helped me understand the class materials
            thoroughly. Taking 2112 was definitely rewarding, and with the experience of handling the heavy workload, I
            am
            more confident to face the challenges of future advanced CS courses. So if you don&rsquo;t know whether CS
            2110
            or CS 2112 fits you better, try both during the first few weeks and see for yourself which one you can
            handle
            better. And a general rule of thumb is that when you are not sure whether a particular class is worth
            taking,
            or
            just want to know if you can handle the workload of the class, always feel free to ask someone who has
            already
            taken it for advice.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Finally, some suggestions: first of all, go to office hours! The people there
            are
            prepared to help you, and sometimes you may even find a better solution to a problem at hand by just
            talking
            to
            the teaching assistant. (Check out</span>

              duck debugging</a></span><span class="c22">.) Additionally, look for various opportunities on campus for
            CS
            majors, such as teaching or research positions. For instance, if you feel you are doing pretty well in a
            class
            and hope to share your passion for the class and help other students, you can apply for a position as a
            teaching
            assistant. Lastly, join events held by CS-related student organizations such as ACSU and WICC! They
            frequently
            organize events such as guest lectures, the student-faculty luncheon, and at the end of the year, the CS
            formal.</span></p>

        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Coming in, I was pretty certain I was going to stick with CS as a major and
            taking
            more classes helped me solidify that decision. However, I was interested in many other fields and was
            struggling
            to choose a double major/minor. As of now I&#39;m leaning towards double majoring in Math and CS, which
            helped me
            decide to transfer to Arts and Sciences from Engineering because the Math major is not offered in the
            Engineering
            school. There&#39;s a lot of discussion about whether Arts or Engineering has a better environment for
            studying
            CS, but I personally thought being in Arts would be better in approaching the theoretical side of CS I want

            explore. </span></p>

            except for my chill APCS class I took during high school. Sometime during the second assignment I panicked
            so
            hard I dropped the class and told my friend I&#39;m going to give up my CS major and become an AEP major.
            Then I
            decided to sit in CS 2110 and realized that I was actually enjoying CS 2112 a lot, so I added the class
            back
            in
            and somehow survived through it. It was definitely painful at times, but I ended up meeting so many
            talented
            and
            motivated people in the class, and I learned so much from the class itself and the people around me. I
            would
            definitely recommend to incoming freshmen CS majors to challenge themselves and dive into as many
            meme-worthy/difficult classes or activities as possible.</span></p>
        <p class="c4 c15 c64"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Another thing I learned during freshman year was that lectures, office hours,
            and
            readings are actually pretty important. This applies to all classes but I think this is good to emphasize.
            In
            general, I&#39;m excessively lazy and fairly unmotivated, and that accompanied by my poor time management
            skills
            resulted in me skipping hilarious amounts of lectures, doing readings and assignments half-heartedly, and
            not
            going to office hours for the past year. Habits are hard to throw away so it&#39;s probably going to be a
            while
            for me to stop doing this, but I genuinely wish that I realized earlier how important being an earnest
            student
            is, especially in CS. </span></p>
        <p class="c4 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c22">Also, I was surprised to find how welcoming the CS community at Cornell was.
            There&#39;s a lot of diversity in our student population in comparison to other institutions, and I am
            always
            proud and happy to tell others that I am a CS major here. Although I have experienced only a year of
            Cornell
            so
            far, I haven&#39;t yet felt discriminated because of my gender as a female CS student, and I am grateful
            for
            the
            support for women in computing. Overall, I&#39;m glad that I chose Cornell for studying CS and I hope my
            remaining years are as, or more, academically intriguing and challenging as my freshman year has been.</span>

        </section>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">My first experience with CS at Cornell was the CS Placement Exam that places you
            out
            of Python. I was a student that came to Cornell with little CS experience but was set on the major just
            because I
            thought I wouldn&rsquo;t like anything else. Fast forward and one year later, and my feelings are pretty
            much
            the
            same except that a bond of affection has replaced the indifference to CS (Stockholm syndrome at its
            finest).
            &nbsp;Since I passed the exam, I ended up taking 2110 and 2800 my first semester, which are pretty much the
            bread
            and butter (or maybe the flour and the milk that you use to make the bread and butter) of your CS
            curriculum.
            &nbsp;In retrospect, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter if you take these first or second semester. If you do
            not
            take them the first semester, take the time to adjust to Cornell and focus on other things since you will
            still
            have the time to take the classes without a rush the next semester. If you do end up taking the classes, be
            sure
            to spend an adequate amount of time on them as the concepts never go away, and the effort you put into a
            class
            and the challenges you face can benefit you in the long run. Since I was still adjusting to Cornell during
            that
            timeframe, I did not understand the importance and the way prelims worked and how they affect your grades
            and
            therefore underperformed. I was then encouraged by my peers and closed out the semester with satisfactory
            results. What I learned the most out of that semester is that you should never be afraid to ask. Asking
            others
            for help, even professors, may seem scary at first but you soon come to realize that everyone who is around
            you
            wants you to succeed and is sometimes even willing to put in extra time to help. Even if you are starting a
            project the day it is due both professors and TA&rsquo;s are still willing to help you learn, as long as
            you
            yourself are willing to put in the effort. What I want to pass down is that you should know (or at least
            think
            you know) what you want to get out of your first year. In order to know what you want, you have to know
            what
            is
            available. Therefore, don&rsquo;t hesitate to find out, talk to people, go to events, and start building an
            answer to that question. Things are always easier when you have a realistic goal.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I remember debating whether to take CS 1110 or CS 2110 my first semester at
            Cornell.
            Since I was pretty set on majoring in CS, I went ahead and signed up for CS 2110 because I thought
            affiliating as
            soon as possible was my best option. In retrospect, this wasn&#39;t the smartest decision I made. Not only
            did it
            not help me affiliate sooner, but I also missed out on a chance to learn Python. This obviously doesn&#39;t
            apply
            to you if you&#39;ve already mastered Python. If you, however, find yourself in a similar situation, just
            go
            ahead and take CS 1110. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Choose your CS partners wisely. Try to become partners with someone with good
            work
            ethic and communication skills. If you don&#39;t, you will spend countless nights of frustration and
            misery.
          </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Join ACSU&#39;s mentorship program! My mentor told me about various
            opportunities
            available to freshmen and helped me decide which classes to take. It&#39;s also just nice to have someone
            older
            tell you about their experiences and perspectives. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Start assignments early. Go to office hours early. Study for prelims early.
            Procrastination is the cause of all bad GPAs. I thought I could pull off what I did in high school in
            college,
            but people here are way too smart for that. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I personally was very self-conscious about my lack of experience and didn&#39;t
            apply
            to the programs oriented to underclassmen. Nobody cares that you applied and got rejected, so just apply to
            everything. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">My last advice is to make a lot of friends. Opportunities to make new friends
            dwindle
            as years go by, and you will regret it if you don&#39;t have friends. After all, CS is no fun if you
            don&#39;t
            have friends to complain about classes with.</span></p>

        </section>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I decided to become a CS major my second semester freshman year, after I had
            taken
            1110 and 2110 and loved it. Thus as a sophomore, I affiliated with the CS major. I handed in my affiliation
            form
            just before the summer, and was notified of acceptance at the start of my first semester sophomore year.
            Although
            it is not required that you affiliate with your major until the second semester of sophomore year, I felt
            it
            was
            convenient to affiliate early, as you will be able to get a CS advisor early on, and are allowed to
            pre-enroll in
            4000 level classes that are open to CIS students only during pre-enroll.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for classes taken, once 2110 and 2800 are out of the way in Freshman year, a
            variety of 3000 and 4000 level classes are open. As an elective, I took CS 4320 and the practicum, CS 4321.
            At
            first it was very intimidating to sit in a 4000 level class as a Sophomore, but after a while I realized
            that
            courses have prerequisites for a reason, and once you meet those, it does not matter which year you are in
            the
            course, as you will already have the prior knowledge necessary to succeed in the course. However, the
            workload
            for 3000 and 4000 level classes are considerably larger than what I had experienced in freshman year, which
            took
            some time to get used to. In my second semester I took CS 3152, Intro to Game Design, which turned out to
            have
            the largest workload in all my classes, but also one of my favorite classes at Cornell. It was an awesome
            and
            rewarding experience. Personally, I feel that sophomore year is a year to knock off some core classes such
            as
            CS
            3110 and 3410/3420, but also take some time to explore the great variety of 4000 level electives out there.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I also took some time during sophomore year to explore TAing opportunities. I
            was
            a
            course consultant for both semesters, and found it very rewarding, because I get to help other students in
            their
            coursework, refresh my memory in the concepts that I might have forgotten from class, as well as learn how
            to
            explain my thoughts clearly to another person. I would highly recommend TAing some of your favorite classes
            if
            you like the class/professor, want to help others, or just want to make some money through this on-campus
            job.
          </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overall I find sophomore year a great year to explore opportunities, whether it
            is
            enrolling in some interesting 4000 level classes, diving into the internship search, trying out research,
            or
            TAing some classes to help your peers. It is your second year, when you are familiar with what Cornell has
            to
            offer, but do not have to worry about graduation yet. So make it count. </span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is quite hard to isolate my sophomore CS life from all I have been through at
            Cornell. I came to Cornell with undecided major and was truly overwhelmed by how many options are out there
            when
            I was a freshman. Trying to explore as many subjects as possible in the first year, I had my first CS
            course,
            CS
            1110, in the spring semester and officially considered CS as a potential major on my list. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Since I was quite determined to be an Economics major, Sophomore life for me
            was
            to
            explore more about CS, make sure if I&rsquo;m truly interested (because CS is not easy!) and balance the
            courses
            between Econ and CS. After taking the courses needed to declare the major, 2110 and 2800, I affiliated the
            major
            at the end of the first semester. Although CS advisor would not be assigned until the summer, I still found
            it
            better to affiliate early because students in CS major could more easily get the 4000 level course in
            pre-enroll
            period. Because I made up my mind to become a CS major in Sophomore year and hadn&rsquo;t taken a lot of
            courses
            before, I just stuck to the </span>
          <span class="c14"><a class="c3" href="#h.rul7hzfgzniz">CS flowchart</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and took
            only
            one CS core class (CS 3410) in the spring semester. Trying to plan my courses for Economics and CS, I also
            feel
            it is wise to decide the majors as early as possible for students with double or triple majors. It helps a
            lot to
            reasonably schedule the courses for all majors and college requirements later and to discuss with advisors
            or
            other faculty about your questions for future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In general, I think sophomore year is for exploring and balancing. As an
            underclassman, I still had plenty of time to take courses I&rsquo;m interested in, explore academic
            activities
            and college life, and prepare for junior and senior years. Also, don&rsquo;t worry if you have any
            questions.

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I already knew I was going to major in CS by the time I was a sophomore, but I
            had
            no
            idea which concentration to focus on, what electives to take, when I was going to take what class... But if
            I
            had
            one piece of advice, I would say definitely affiliate early! You won&#39;t necessarily get an advisor
            earlier,
            but you&#39;ll get the whole affiliating paperwork over and done with before your sophomore year really
            hits
            you
            hard, and you will have a leg up during pre-enroll if you want to get higher-level CS electives. And what
            you
            put
            down on your checklist won&#39;t lock you into a certain external specialization or vector--you can change
            it
            later very easily. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Affiliating early also helps you get your priorities straight, whether you
            realize
            you
            want to knock out the rest of your college requirements, or if you want to start taking more advanced
            classes
            right away. It helped me solidify my strategy going into sophomore year: try to get just one CS core class
            done
            per semester so I could really do well in it, finish off most of my engineering requirements, and try a
            couple of
            higher-level CS electives. Easier said than done, and I ended up making my sophomore year far too heavy
            credit-wise such that I was drowning in coursework for most of the time. But the silver lining to that is
            that I
            get to have lighter course loads for my next two years!</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I guess freshman year, for me, was more about diving into college life and
            acclimating
            to a new academic work ethic; sophomore year was more about finding what is good (and really, really bad)
            for
            work-life balance. I got a lot more involved with my community, but I was also better at managing my own
            schedule. The resources and networks at Cornell and within Cornell&#39;s CS department are super helpful
            for
            getting advice on pretty much anything, so make sure to take advantage of it!</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For me, the prospect of sophomore year was exciting because now that I had
            finished
            the basic intro courses in the CS major, I could take more advanced 3000-level courses as well as the
            entire
            range of 4000-level electives. I signed up a pretty heavy combination of CS core and elective classes,
            which
            was
            tough and kept me more busy than I ever was freshman year, especially since I had started interviewing with
            a
            few
            companies and needed time to prepare for that. It wasn&rsquo;t all bad though, because I still enjoyed
            spending
            most of my time taking CS courses that I was interested in rather than college requirements I just had to
            get
            done with. Two important things I learned this year:</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">1) Electives (both CS and non-CS) can be really unpredictable -- there were some
            that
            sounded cool but ended up dull, and there were some that I took on a whim and ended up loving, so

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I started out comparatively late in computer science (after Freshman year).
            During
            my
            sophomore year, I was hesitant in trying out things because I thought I wasn&rsquo;t qualified to do them.
            I
            was
            also worried of me being &ldquo;late&rdquo; (after all, there are people in the CS department who start CS
            as
            early as elementary school). Now, though, I feel that no one really is &ldquo;late&rdquo; and all that
            matters is
            how much you do and how much you like what you are doing. If anyone is feeling &ldquo;late&rdquo; (I had a
            lot of
            friends who were in the same boat--one of my friends decided to major in CS in their junior year) rest
            assured
            that there is no such thing as &ldquo;late.&rdquo; Also, try to talk to as many people as possible and
            figure
            out
            what you need to do. Cool thing that happened to me--I talked to a random guy in my swimming class, and he
            turned
            out to be an intern at Microsoft. He told me what I needed to do and how to apply for internships (I
            didn&rsquo;t
            even know how a career fair worked!). The CS community is very large and diverse, so you can always find
            someone
            to ask for help.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Transitioning into sophomore year as a computer science major is perhaps one of
            the
            greatest &ldquo;power spikes&rdquo; you will have in your four years at Cornell. As a sophomore who had
            completed
            his intro courses freshman year, I was able to begin diving into the upper level classes and figuring out
            for
            myself where my interests lie. It is also the perfect time to actually see what is ahead of you, in terms
            of
            classes to take in order to graduate and internship opportunities that arise because of your new standing
            and
            experience. Overall I believe that sophomore year is the time for you to experiment with the opportunities
            that
            Cornell gives you. I ended up TA&rsquo;ing my first class sophomore year which showed me how much more
            there
            is
            to learning the material presented in class and it opened my eyes as to how it is like being on the other
            side of
            the table and how much our professors care about us as students. I also ended up taking a dance class which
            I
            would place outside of my comfort zone. &nbsp;Therefore I recommend you take this time and really shaping
            your
            life beyond academics and the mentality you built freshman year. &nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">My junior year was a sharp contrast from my underclassmen years. Having
            completed
            a
            good chunk of the requirements for the College of Engineering and the Computer Science core, this was the
            first
            year when I started taking 4000-level CS courses that interested me. I found this to be true for a lot of
            my
            friends too. Some dedicated their whole semester to their external specializations and other requirements
            that
            they didn&rsquo;t even take a single CS course for a semester. I also found myself much busier than
            previous
            years, mostly due to interviews. Unlike freshmen and sophomore years, I found that I got a lot more
            attention
            from companies due to my status as a junior. Thankfully, I had a light-enough coursework for me to
            interview
            with
            as many places as I could afford to. Outside of classes, it was also interesting being an upperclassmen
            rather
            than an underclassmen. I also found myself taking leadership roles in clubs and getting involved in other
            activities on-campus as the leader rather than the follower I was in my underclassmen years.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Based on this, these are my tips for a rising junior in Computer Science</span></p>
        <ol class="c9 lst-kix_7f7zwkkdz45j-0 start" start="1">
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">Get involved in something outside of classes and interview! </span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">When you interview with places, also look for what the companies have to
              offer
              you, and start figuring out which places appeal to you and which places do not; this will pay dividends
              and
              save you a lot of time when you start looking for full-time jobs </span></li>
          <li class="c2 c7"><span class="c1">Challenge yourself with interesting CS electives, but don&rsquo;t forget
              to
              diversify your schedule with classes from other disciplines as well!</span></li>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For me, junior year was all about really exploring the things I was interested
            in,
            but
            also giving myself breathing room to enjoy my experiences at Cornell. With a lot of my engineering college
            requirements and liberal studies electives out of the way, I was more free to choose specific CS electives.
            I
            also started taking up additional responsibilities outside of my normal coursework by becoming a TA and
            involving
            myself in my club activities more. Because of this, I feel that being a junior is all about finally
            striking
            a
            good balance between work and play, which is especially important since junior year is when you should
            definitely
            be considering post-college options: what kind of work environment you want, what kind of company culture
            you
            desire, where you want to move, etc. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A lot of other juniors will be interviewing for summer internships or research
            positions, so I found it a good idea to get some practice in before the recruiting season to stay on top of
            my
            game. However, it becomes really hard to not get down on yourself if you get rejected multiple times--and
            it&rsquo;s times like those where you really have to take a step back and tell yourself you&rsquo;re doing
            fine.
            You&rsquo;re already at Cornell University and in a top CS program, so you&rsquo;re already in a great
            position
            compared to thousands of other people! It&rsquo;s all well and good to have a goal or dream position you
            aspire
            to, but not if you&rsquo;re wrecking yourself to get there.</span></p>

            year
            is the regular season. You are given a much wider breadth of opportunities, and your choices matter all the
            more.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">While some students know exactly what kind of field they want to enter as early
            as
            freshman year, I spent my junior year nailing down exactly what I wanted to do. Now that many of the core
            requirements were out of the way, I was able to explore classes as diverse as machine learning, operating
            systems, and programming logics. Just taking these at the same time helped me figure out how I really
            wanted
            to
            spend my time.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found it very difficult to balance my heavy workload with the job/internship
            search.
            I advise you to study up on technical interviews as early as possible, and to brush up before the fall of
            Junior
            Year, when most companies are looking. It is definitely possible to find a job during the spring, but
            figuring
            out your summer plans early helps ease your second semester of the year.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a junior, you might also find yourself entering leadership roles in the
            activities
            you pursue. You will find yourself experienced enough to make authoritative decisions but still young
            enough
            to
            join new groups and make impacts in those groups.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Junior year is also an appropriate time to figure out what you want do after
            your
            undergraduate education. It is a good idea to remind yourself of how close you are to fulfilling your
            graduation
            requirements, and whether you qualify for early graduation or a higher-education program. Don&rsquo;t get
            stuck
            or caught up in being satisfied with a single goal. Understand you are nearing the end, but remember to be
            reasonably flexible with your plan.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">By your senior year, one of your main worries will be what kind of career you
            want
            to
            pursue after graduation. What I&rsquo;ve come to find out is that questions like these can never be
            answered
            in a
            short amount of time. Throughout your sophomore and junior year, you should always let this question sit in
            the
            back of your mind. Often times, it&rsquo;s easy to get swept up with questions like &ldquo;which company do
            smart
            people work for?&rdquo; or &ldquo;which route pays the most?&rdquo; but in the end, a person&rsquo;s career
            is
            his/her own personal journey. It will bring you happiness and satisfaction to decide to do you want to do
            based
            on your preferences alone. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was something I didn&rsquo;t learn until I was interviewing for company
            after
            company and I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t even answer a simple question about why I wanted to work at a
            certain place. It was hard to be genuine when I had applied to the companies that my friends were applying
            to
            based on the reputations that my friends had told me. When it came down to making a decision, I was missing
            the
            conviction that this career path was what I had been working towards all along. The lesson I learned real
            late in
            the game is that to develop a real purpose of wanting to do something, you have to put your own time into
            doing
            your own thinking.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">CS degree in particular has one of the highest variability in terms of what you
            can
            do, and it&rsquo;s hard to find out what you like and dislike if you don&rsquo;t try enough things. CS at
            Cornell
            has so many paths to offer, and it&rsquo;s never too late to join a club. I encourage you to try out
            something
            you haven&rsquo;t yet because, in the end, being conscious of your own motivations and goals while being
            open
            to
            trying out new things will go a long way in ultimately helping you define where you will take your career.</span></p>

        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Background</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went into Cornell telling myself &ldquo;don&rsquo;t focus on the grades, just
            try
            your best&rdquo; because &ldquo;the journey is more important than the destination&rdquo; :P right. I
            learned
            the
            hard way &ndash; the journey IS important, but quality is MUCH better than quantity of time spent studying.
            I
            focused so much on studying and improving my efficiency at studying that I really undervalued many other
            aspects
            at Cornell.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What&rsquo;s my actual point?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Take a good look around you and appreciate the people you have the privilege of
            meeting. Sure, you won&rsquo;t get along with everyone. Sure, when you work on a project and your partner
            seems
            hopelessly incompetent (they probably aren&rsquo;t, you have no idea what&rsquo;s going on in their
            life/what
            they&rsquo;re going through!), you probably get a little annoyed. And sure, you might have a few housemate
            problems to work out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Focus on what their strengths are. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c22">It seems like a no brainer and clich&eacute; to focus on the positives and the
            strengths of people around you, but it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;really</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;easy
            to focus on negatives, what needs to be done, what can be improved, etc. because let&rsquo;s face it
            &ndash;
            we&rsquo;re human!</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had the most fun at Cornell when I stopped to appreciate people for who they
            were
            instead of [constantly] fixating on apartment chores, interviews, prelims, and so on. I took classes in the
            Human
            Ecology, ILR, Arts and Sciences, and Engineering colleges my last semester and met a plethora of super
            diverse,
            interesting, and awesome people. Although many (including myself) may think that ILR is on the opposite
            spectrum
            of CS, I gained a completely different and valuable perspective by taking Intro to Conflict Resolution and
            Negotiation. I also had the privilege of studying with an ILR student in that class who made me realize
            that
            his
            approach to learning and synthesizing the class material was far superior to my diligent word-for-word note
            taking and regurgitation (although sometimes this style worked really well for me in other classes!). (***
            Tangent: My favorite Cornell class &ndash; Human Bonding &ndash; was in the Human Ecology school. Yes, I
            was
            a CS

            bring to the table, [study efficiently,] and enjoy the Cornell experience.</span></p>
