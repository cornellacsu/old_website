    <ol start="1">
        <li>The Chapter is organized and will be operated exclusively for educational and scientific purposes to promote the following:</li>

        <li>Greater interest in computing and its applications.</li>
        <li>A means of communication between persons having an interest in computing</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>The Chapter will serve students at Cornell University&nbsp;and other interested persons in the Ithaca&nbsp;community.</li>
        <li>The Chapter is chartered by the ACM.</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    <h4>Article III: Membership</h4>
    <p>The provisions of this section must conform to the membership provisions specified in ACM's Bylaws (Bylaw 5, Section 5; ACM Constitution Article 3).</p>
