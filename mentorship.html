                              <h3>Guidelines & Expectations</h3>
                              <p>Both mentors and mentees are expected to meet at least once a month for the semester unless special circumstances arise. ACSU will aid in this commitment with several mentorship socials and exciting activities for the mentorship community.</p>
                              <p>Actively participate in mentee/mentor challenges -- there will be a prize at the end of the semester for those who go far and beyond the call of duty
                        Mentees should seek out mentors for advice concerning career plans, academic plans, and social plans. Remember, your mentors are your resources. Do not feel constrained to a single mentor but instead take advantage of the resources around you.</p>
                              <p>Mentors are expected to offer professional advice when needed and extend themselves as personal contacts to their mentees.</p>
                              <p>Do not dismiss mentees nor mentors. If a problem arises between your mentor/mentees and needs to be addressed, contact ACSU Social Team Officers.</p>
