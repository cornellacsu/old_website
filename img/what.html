                <h4>Our Purpose</h4>
                <p style="margin-left:3em; margin-right:3em">The Association of Computer Science Undergraduates (ACSU) is Cornell's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). We promote educational, professional, and social interaction among students interested in computer science and facilitate student communication with faculty, alumni, and corporate representatives to enhance the undergraduate experience in computer science. The ACSU receives support from the Department of Computer Science and several corporate sponsors.</p>
