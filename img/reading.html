                                <p> Inspired after MIT's<a href="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/files/urge/urge.html"> URGE </a> program, the ACSU has initiated our own undergraduate Reading Groups.
                                    <br/> Our reading group are open for anyone who is interested, regardless of background.

                            <h3> Overview </h3>
                            <p>
                                ACSU Reading groups are small groups of less than 10 undergraduate students meeting regularly to discuss technical papers to encourage learning in a casual environment. These groups would be open for anyone who is interested, regardless of background. Each reading group would have a reading group leader who would be responsible for choosing the technical paper and leading the discussions. The participants would read the paper beforehand, come prepared with 1-2 questions and be ready to join the discussion.</p>
